BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
Foreword 
Recent decades have seen an unprecedented growth in demand for natural resources and 
the materials derived from them. Around 80 billion tonnes of minerals, fossil fuels, and 
biomass were fed into the global economy in 2011, and this is only likely to increase with 
population growth and improved standards of living. OECD modelling indicates that 
resource use may more than double by 2060 under business as usual. 
Continued depletion of the planet’s natural resource stock will have a number of 
economic and envi ronmental consequences. First, ongoing harvesting of mineral ores, 
fossil fuel reserves, and agricultural land will tend to place upwards pressure on resource 
prices, affecting resource access and economic development. Second, resource depletion 
in some countries, and the resulting concentration of supply in others, will tend to 
increase the likelihood of geo -politically related supply shocks. Third, the environmental 
pressures associated with the extraction, use, and disposal of natural resources will 
probably grow, with adverse impacts on quality of life as well as future economic growth.   
These issues have sparked recent interest in how to decouple economic activity from 
natural resource use and their environmental impacts. Improved resource efficiency and a 
transition to a more circular economy are seen as key ways forward. Many countries have 
launched national circular economy, resource efficiency, or sustainable materials 
management roadmaps. Resource efficiency has also been included in the G7 and G20 
agendas, as well as being central to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
In practice, decoupling can be pursued along several pathways, including improved 
productivity at the firm level and a shift towards services. However, achieving real 
progress will also require that greener modes of production and consumption – circular 
business models as they are called in this report – gain a greater foothold in our 
economies. The traditional linear model of resource extraction, product ownership, and 
eventual disposal is unlikely to deliver the sustainable future that we want. 
Business Models for a Circular Economy: Opportunities and Challenges from a Policy 
Perspective has been developed by the Environmental Policy Committee’s Working Party 
on Resource Productivity and Waste. The report addresses the key characteristics, 
potential scalability, and likely environmental impacts of five headline circular business 
models. The use of  renewable materials in manufacturing, the recycling and 
remanufacturing of end of life products, and the sharing and leasing of already existing 
assets are all considered. By identifying the factors that are currently hindering the 
broader adoption of circular business models, this report can help to support policy efforts 
to transition to a more resource efficient and circular economy.

BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
Executive Summary 
Natural resources, and the materials derived from them, represent the physical basis for 
the economic system. Recent decades have witnessed an unprecedented growth in 
demand for these resources. This has triggered interest from policymakers in transitioning 
to a more resource efficient and circular economy.  
The present report focusses on the current scale and possible environmental impacts 
of five business models that could support the transition to a more resource efficient 
and circular economy. Each business model modifies the pattern of product and material 
flows through the economy. By doing so, they have the potential to reduce the 
environmental pressures that result from current systems of production and consumption. 
The exact mechanisms vary: 
 Circular supply models replac e traditional material inputs derived from virgin 
resources with bio -based, renewable, or recovered materials,  which reduces 
demand for virgin resource extraction in the long run 
 Resource recovery models recycle waste into secondary raw materials, thereby 
diverting waste from final disposal while also displacing the extraction and 
processing of virgin natural resources 
 Product life extension models extend the use period of existing products, slow the 
flow of constituent materials through the economy, and reduce the rate of 
resource extraction and waste generation  
 Sharing models facilitate the sharing of under -utilised products, and can therefore 
reduce demand for new products and their embedded raw materials 
 Product service system models, where services rather than products are marketed, 
improve incentives for green product design and more efficient product use, 
thereby promoting a more sparing use of natural resources 
Not all of these business models are necessarily new. Recycling, reuse, and repair have 
existed for millennia. The sharing of under-utilised household possessions also has a long 
history, and the provision of access to products, rather than ownership of them, is not so 
different from traditional product leasing. What is new is the growing diversity and 
sophistication of these business models, as well as the range of sectors they are adopted 
in.  
The market share held by these business models is small but there is considerable 
room for future scale up . In most sectors, t he market penetration of circul ar business 
models remains limited and is usually no more than 5 to 10% in economic terms. 
Although some business models have experienced rapid recent growth, much of this has 
been from a very low base, and has been confined to a handful of economic niches . 
Consequently, there remains considerable potential for the scale up of circular economy 
business models, both within and across sectors.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,14
"14 │ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
Some circular business models are more amenable to more widespread adoption than 
others. Waste recycling and product reuse and repair, for instance, have a long history and 
are relatively mature. Achieving higher rates of market penetration for these more mature 
circular business models  will require significant changes to existing policy frameworks. 
In some instances, this is already happening; the  recent adoption of a comprehensive 
strategy on plastics in the European Union is one such example.  
There are a number of other business mode ls that have appeared more recently, and are 
scaling up rapidly. Technological innovation s along with an increased consumer 
willingness to pay for green products seem to have been important drivers. For sharing 
models, and for certain variants of product s ervice system models,  for instance,  the 
emergence of the internet, mobile phone technology, and the development of referral and 
reputational systems have allowed certain products to be shared more widely than ever 
before. Airbnb has gone from being a curiosity in the accommodation sector ten years ago 
to being the largest single supplier of short -term stays today. Similarly, global 
membership of urban car sharing schemes is growing at an annual rate of up to 65%.   
More widespread adoption of circular busin ess models would significantly reduce 
environmental pressures, although there is uncertainty about possible rebound 
effects. The information compiled in this report allows three main conclusions to be 
drawn on the environmental implications of broader circular business model adoption:  
 Insights from the lifecycle assessment literature indicate that the environmental 
footprint of circular products and services are typically significantly smaller than 
that for traditional products, which could have important first order environmental 
benefits.  
 These first order benefits will not be evenly distributed across the product 
lifecycle. For example, remanufacturing reduces emissions and environmental 
pressures upstream associated with resource extraction, whereas sh aring and 
product service system models also reduce pressures associated with the product 
use-phase. 
 The overall environmental impact will also depend on indirect economic spillover 
and feedback effects. For example, in the context of sharing models, it ha s been 
shown that Airbnb rooms are typically 15 – 20% cheaper than equivalent hotel 
rooms. The consumer savings that this generates may well be allocated to 
additional consumption, which may partially or fully offset  first order 
environmental gains.  
In order to realise the environmental benefits, policy frameworks will need to evolve 
to create the conditions for wider uptake of circular business models.  Ultimately, 
achieving a genuine transition to a more circular economy will be unlikely if circular 
business models continue to occupy small economic niches. Policy can play an important 
role by addressing the market failures, policy misalignments and status quo biases that 
currently hinder the competitiveness of these business models, including: 
 ensuring that the full environmental costs of production and consumption 
activities are reflected in market prices; 
 improving collaboration within and across secto ral value chains, through e.g. 
fostering industrial symbiosis clusters, promoting online material marketplaces or 
establishing secondary raw material certification schemes, and, more generally, 
facilitation of cooperation within;",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,15

 ensuring that existing regulatory frameworks are coherent and fit for purpose, and 
not serving to preserve an existing status quo; 
 improving existing educational and infor mation programs to provide individuals 
with a better understanding of the unintended consequences of their consumption 
choices (e.g. behavioural insights and nudges); 
 promoting the supply of circular products (“supply-push measures”) or demand  
for them (“demand -pull measures”). For the former this includes eco -design 
standards, strengthened extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes, and the 
provision of targeted R&D funding. Examples of the latter include differentiated 
VAT rates, recycled content mandates, and product labelling standards.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,16

Chapter 1.  Introduction 
This chapter sets out the motivation for the development of this report. It notes the rapid 
growth of resource extraction, use and disposal that has taken place in recent years, and 
the adverse environmental impacts that are occurring as a result. Improved  resource 
efficiency and a transition to a more circular economy are then highlighted as potential 
solutions to these issues: using natural resources relatively sparingly would allow 
economic growth to be decoupled from its less desirable environmental sid e-effects. The 
chapter concludes by identifying the more widespread adoption of circular business 
models as a concrete means of achieving decoupling.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,18

BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
Recent decades have witnessed an unprecedented growth in demand for resources. This 
has been driven by the rapid industrialisation of emerging economies and continued high 
levels of material consumption in developed countries. As a result, the weight of 
materials consumed worldwide has more than doubled since 1980, and increased ten -fold 
since 1900. By 2060, the world population is expected to increase from about 7 billion to 
about 10 billion (UN, 2017 [1]). At the same time,  per capita income of the world’s 
population is expected to roughly triple (OECD, 2019[2]). This will substantially increase 
demand for natural resources, especially if global production and consumption patterns 
converge with those of OECD countries.  OECD modelling indicates that global primary 
materials use may more than double from 79 Gt in 2011 to 167 Gt in 2060, if existing 
trends continue (OECD, 2019[2]). 
Continued rapid growth in natural resource use will have several economic and 
environmental consequenc es. First, ongoing harvesting of the highest quality mineral 
ores, fossil fuel reserves, and areas of agricultural land will tend to stimulate higher 
resource prices, with potentially negative consequences for resource access and economic 
development.1 Second, resource depletion in some countries, and the resulting 
concentration of supply in others, will tend to increase the likelihood of geo -politically 
related supply shocks. This may begin to represent a considerable operational risk for 
manufacturing firms with relatively one dimensional supply chains. Third, the 
environmental pressures generated by the extraction, processing, and disposal of natural 
resources will continue to weigh upon the planet’s sink capacity and, in some cases, 
become a constraint on economic activity. At the firm level, the threat of climate or other 
environmental regulation will become a significant business risk for resource intensive or 
polluting firms.  
These concerns have led to increased interest in how to decouple economi c activity from 
resource inputs and the generation of polluting by -products (Box 1.1) . Promoting 
improved resource efficiency has become a major focus at the international level, and a 
succession of multilateral initiatives and frameworks have been introdu ced. An OECD 
Council Recommendation issued in 2008 encouraged member countries to “take 
appropriate actions to improve resource productivity and reduce negative environmental 
impacts of materials and product use”. In the same year, G8 environment ministers signed 
the Kobe 3R Action Plan, in which countries agreed to prioritise implementation of 3Rs 
policy in order to improve resource productivity. There have also been several important 
recent developments. The creation of the G7 Alliance on Resource Efficie ncy at Schloss 
Elmau in 2015, and the subsequent adoption of the Toyama Framework on Material 
Cycles, signalled increasing interest from G7 countries. The inclusion of specific goals 
related to resource efficiency in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develop ment also 
represented a major landmark. Finally, the introduction of resource efficiency into the 
G20 agenda in 2017 was notable, particularly given the presence in that forum of various 
countries with large resource endowments.  
At the national level, tra nsitioning to a more circular economy is also receiving 
considerable attention. Circular economy roadmaps have been introduced in the People’s 
Republic of China (hereafter China) in 2013, in the European Union in 2015, and in 
Finland, France, the Netherlan ds, and Scotland in 2016. Other countries have introduced 
national level policy frameworks with different names, but with largely similar 
objectives. Japan’s Fundamental Law for Establishing a Sound Material -Cycle Society 
and the United States’ Sustainable Materials Management Program Strategic Plan are two 
such examples.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,19

In practice, there are various channels through which decoupling, improved resource 
efficiency, or the transition to a more circular economy can be achieved. At the aggregate 
level, decoupling could result from changes in the structure of the economy; a de mand 
driven increase in the share of services in total output for example. At the level of 
individual production facilities, decoupling could result from technologically driven 
improvements in resource productivity; incremental improvements in the proporti on of 
metal recovered from mineral ores for example. A third channel, and the one that 
represents the main focus of this report, involves “circular modes of production” or, put 
differently, activities that use virgin non -renewable resources (and the materi als derived 
from them) relatively sparingly.  
  
Box 1.1. The potential benefits of a transition to a more resource efficient and circular 
economy 
The transition to a more resource efficient and circular economy is not usually considered 
to be a policy goal in itself. Rather, it is the economic, environmental, and social gains 
that might accompany such a transition that seem to be of interest for governments. 
Specific benefits that are often ci ted include, (i) a reduction in the environmental 
pressures – greenhouse gas emissions, particulate pollution, toxicity, biodiversity loss etc 
– arising from current systems of production and consumption, (ii) economic expansion 
and job creation driven by the emergence of new opportunities in certain sectors, and (iii) 
reduced risk of raw material supply shocks either in the short term (due to geo -political 
factors), or in the longer term (due to natural resource depletion). 
There is an emerging body of wor k that uses macroeconomic modelling tools to assess 
the second issue – that relating to economic growth and employment. The majority of 
existing modelling assessments find that a policy driven transition to a more resource 
efficient and circular economy co uld take place with (potentially significant) positive 
impacts on economic growth (McCarthy, Dellink and Bibas, 2018 [3]). That said, this 
literature is rather limited in scope, and often includes ad -hoc assumptions that are overly 
optimistic. Ongoing modelling work at the OECD and elsewhere is beginning to address 
these issues. 
This report addresses the first issue – the reductions in environmental pressure that could 
result from a circular economy transition. It focusse s on the key activities – or business 
models – that will be required to drive such a transition, and assesses their scalability and 
environmental footprint relative to traditional (or “linear”) equivalents. The firm level 
approach taken in this report is i ntended to serve as a complement to the macroeconomic 
modelling work discussed above.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,20

BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
 
Circular modes of production, and the business  models that underpin them, involve 
fundamentally different ways of producing and consuming goods and services. The 
production of raw materials from waste, the reuse, repair, or remanufacture of unwanted 
or damaged products, and the sharing of already existing products are just three examples. 
Not all of these activities are necessarily new, but many are emerging more broadly in 
response to technological developments, urbanisation, heightened supply risks, and 
evolving consumer preferences. For policy makers, these developments raise a number of 
questions. What are the different business models that are of most interest from a circular 
economy perspective? What is their scalability potential? What are the environmental 
outcomes that can be expected from them, and which of them would merit policy support

Resource efficiency is used by UNEP (2017[4]) to refer to a set of ideas including: (i) the 
technical efficiency of resource use, (ii) resource productivity, or the extent to which 
economic value is added to a given quantity of resources, and (iii) the  extent to which 
resource extraction or use has negative impacts on the environment. In concrete terms, 
resource efficiency, or more precisely resource intensity, can be calculated as the ratio 
between the value of economic output from a particular sector or economy, and the 
amount of resources (typically in terms of weight) used to produce it. An improvement in 
resource efficiency therefore describes a situation where more economic value is being 
produced with a particular amount of resources (or one where  fewer resources are being 
used). 
There is no single accepted definition of the circular economy, although a comparison 
with the so -called linear economy (where natural resources are extracted, transformed 
into capital and consumer goods, and eventually di sposed of in landfill or disposal 
facilities) is often made. In this context, emphasis is placed on a variety of mechanisms 
that modify the flow of products and materials through the economy, and ultimately result 
in lower rates of natural resource extract ion. Previous OECD work in this area highlights 
three main mechanisms  (McCarthy, Dellink and Bibas, 2018 [3]): closing resource loops 
(the diversion of waste from disposal and subsequent transformation into secondary ra w 
materials), slowing resource loops or flows (the retention of products, and their 
constituent materials, in the economy for longer periods), and narrowing resource flows 
(generating additional economic value from a fixed amount of natural resources). 
Circular modes of production, and the business models that underpin them, represent the 
key activities that could realise a transition to a more resource efficient and circular 
economy. There is no clear consensus on what is and is not a circular business mod el. 
However, one key aspect – the defining one in the context of this report – is their relative 
sparing use of natural resource inputs. This results not only from facility level 
improvements in material productivity, but also from more fundamental changes  in 
production and consumption patterns. For example, instead of using natural resource 
inputs more efficiently, renewable energy generation and the secondary raw material 
production do not use them at all.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,21

for scale-up? And finally, what are the policy measures that can help accelerate the scale -
up of the most desirable business models? 
This report addresses these questions by drawing together insights from the existing 
literature on circular business models. Chapter 2 introduces a typology of five key 
circular business models and highlights some of their shared characteristics and drivers 
for adoption. Chapter 3 uses well known examples to provide insights into the current 
market penetration, and potential scalability, of each of the headline business models. 
Chapter 4 addresses the environmental impact that could result from t he widespread 
emergence of circular business models. It draws mostly on research from the lifecycle 
assessment literature, but also highlights the importance of economic mechanisms. 
Chapter 5 then briefly sets out the policy measures that could be implemen ted in order to 
promote the more widespread adoption of circular business models.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,22

Notes
 
1  This trend will be offset, to some extent, by various market mechanisms. Higher resource 
prices will trigger new exploration and the discovery of new reserves. They will also encourage 
resource saving technological change and, in some cases, substitution t owards other relatively 
affordable materials.

Chapter 2.  Circular business models 
This chapter focusses on circular business models, their key characteristics, and the main 
drivers for adoption. It begins by presenting a typology of the five headline circular 
business models that are discussed in this report: circular supply, resource r ecovery, 
product life extension, sharing, and product service system models. The key 
characteristics of each of these are then discussed, with a particular focus on the 
underlying business case. The chapter concludes with an overview of the higher level 
factors that could drive the adoption of circular business models in the longer term. 
Technological change and a range of emerging business risks are identified as being of 
particular importance.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,24

This chapter identifies five key business models that could facilitate a transition towards a 
more resource efficient and circular economy. In this report, the term business model is 
used to describe how a firm creates, captures, and delivers value. In other words, it is a 
firm’s competitive strategy. Osterwalder,  Pigneur and Tucci (2010[1]) differentiate nine 
main elements of a business model. These are, the value proposition involved, who the 
key supply chain partners are, what resources and activities are  involved in product 
creation, what their cost structure is, how products are delivered, which customer 
segments are targeted, how customer relationships are managed, and how revenues are 
collected. In this chapter, this framework is applied to five headli ne circular business 
models. Much of the focus is on character of the business case for an adopting firm, but 
attention is also given to the activities involved in production and the characteristics of 
revenue collection. Circular business models are often quite innovative in these respects. 
Circular business models have a number of other distinguishing characteristics beyond 
their relatively sparing use of natural resource inputs. First, the underlying sales strategy 
tends to place less emphasis on maximis ing the sales volume of low -margin and short -
lived products. Instead, the focus tends to be on selling higher quality products or, 
increasingly, marketing access to, rather than ownership of products. Second, the business 
case often leverages the value con tained in already existing materials, components, and 
products. For example, by largely avoiding the use of new material and energy inputs, 
firms offering repair, refurbishment, or remanufacturing services can market products at a 
significantly lower cost than their traditional counterparts. Third, circular business models 
often involve greater levels of collaboration between different actors in the supply chain. 
There are often repeated interactions between suppliers and customers, and this can foster 
a he ightened sense of customer loyalty. For example, operating within an industrial 
symbiosis framework requires significant inter -firm cooperation to ensure the ongoing 
availability of high quality of raw material inputs. 
2.1. A typology of circular business models 
The literature on circular business models is growing rapidly and contains a variety of 
different typologies. There are considerable differences in the level of granularity, as well 
as the classification approach that is taken. Some authors take a value chain perspective 
that structures business models into circular design, optimal use, and value recovery types 
(Achterberg, Hinfelaar and Bocken, 2016 [2]). Others distinguish business models 
according to the material flows they address. IMSA (2015[3]) focus on short loops, long 
loops, cascades, and pure cycles while Lewandowski (2016[4]) focus on regeneration, 
sharing, optimisation, or looping. The activities implicit in all of these typologies overlap 
significantly, but are often given different names.  
The typology that is adopted in this report draws on that developed by Accenture  (Lacy 
and Rutqvist, 2015[5]). In contrast to the typologies discussed above, circular activities are 
categorised according to a business -centric perspective. This draws attention to the 
business proposition underlying each of the business models, which is significant given 
that widespread adoption will remain largely theoretical unless the private sector 
perceives substantial value. The five types of headline circular business models addressed 
in this report  are: (i) circular supply models, (ii) resource recovery models, (iii) product 
life extension models, (iv) sharing models, and (v) product service system models 
(Table 2.1).",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,25

Note: The “sharing platform models” of Accenture have been renamed “sharing models” in order to avoid 
confusion with other business activities that utilise online platforms but that are not necessarily circular (see 
Box 2.2 for additional information). 
While the distinction between each type of business model is clear in theory, it may be 
less so in practice. In some cases, fi rms adopt combinations of business models rather 
than one in isolation. For example, the adoption of product service system model – and 
the retention of product ownership that goes with it – may well serve to incentivise the 
parallel adoption of the produc t life extension model (Thompson et al., 2010[6]). In other 
cases, the decision to adopt a particular circular business model by a firm or group of 
firms can facilitate the adoption of a related busine ss model by others. The adoption of 
the circular supply model, where strategic sourcing and design decisions are made early 
in a product’s life, can improve the business case for component and material recovery 
further downstream.  
Not all of the business models discussed included in this typology are necessarily new or 
novel. The resource recovery business model, where secondary raw materials are 
produced from waste, has operated in the metals sector for millennia. Similarly, ensuring 
that products attain their intended service life through reuse and repair has probably been 
widespread since the emergence of manufacturing. Other business models often appear to 
be novel, but have instead evolved from well -established traditional activities. One 
example invol ves peer to peer sharing of existing, but under -utilised, consumer assets. 
Sharing has always taken place; the distinction today is that it often takes place between 
individuals who did not previously know each other. In this case, it is the emergence and 
diffusion of digital networks, portable devices, and smart software systems that has 
enabled business model evolution. 
Some circular business models do not have obvious historic equivalents. One example 
concerns circular supply models, where traditional ma terial inputs are replaced by bio -
based, renewable, or recoverable materials. These are probably emerging partly in",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,26

response to greener consumer preferences in certain segments of the population. Firms 
are leveraging an increased willingness to pay for gre en products by ensuring that the 
environmental footprint of their supply chains is relatively small. Another example 
concerns product service system models in the context of dematerialised consumer 
products like e -books, streamed music and films, and digit al newspaper subscriptions. 
Digitalisation has meant that the suppliers of these products can avoid the material input 
costs associated with producing physical products, and thereby produce additional output 
with virtually no additional cost.

2.2. Individual circular business model characteristics 
2.2.1. Circular supply models 
Circular supply business models involve the replacement of traditional production inputs 
with bio -based, renewable, or recovered materials. By making strategic sourcing 
decisions at the outset of product development, adopting firms can reduce the 
environmental pressures emanating from their supply chains, while ensuring that the 
materials embedded in their products do not eventually become waste. In this sense, the 
circular supply model can be viewed as a form of resource recovery model, albeit one 
where ma terial recovery is considered at a much earlier stage of the product lifecycle. 
Essentially, waste is designed away.  
The philosophy underlying the circular supply model is often referred to as “cradle to 
cradle” product design. 1 This is intended to create  a distinction with cradle to grave 
material flows, where the materials embedded in products end their lives in incineration 
or landfill facilities. Instead, these materials become inputs in the manufacture of new 
products. In this context, a parallel is o ften drawn with natural systems, where the death 
of an organism results in the cycling of nutrients to other organisms. Cradle -to-cradle is

now also an official certification system, with around 500 certified products. One 
example of a firm selling C2C certified products is Tarkett, a global manufacturer of floor 
coverings (see Annex 1). Other examples include Advance Nonwoven, a Danish 
manufacturer of insulation material, and Green Packaging, an American manufacturer of 
food packaging.  
The business case underlying the adoption of circular supply business models is twofold. 
First, replacing traditional inputs with bio -based, renewable, or recovered equivalents 
allows firms to market their products as “green”. By differentiating their products in this 
way, a dopting firms can target environmentally conscious consumers who are perhaps 
prepared to pay a premium for the knowledge that their consumption decisions have a 
smaller environmental footprint. Second, switching towards alternative material inputs is 
a way  of managing regulatory and supply chain risk. With respect to the former, the 
introduction of more stringent environmental regulation is a possibility in many countries, 
and represents an important business risk for firms using polluting inputs in their 
production process. With respect to the latter, the natural resources from which key 
production inputs are derived are often geographically concentrated in a small number of 
countries, sometimes in politically unstable parts of the world. Manufacturers can at least 
partially mitigate the associated sourcing risk by integrating locally derived secondary 
materials into their supply chains. 
Implementing the circular supply business model has implications for various aspects of a 
firm’s operations. It influences  the conceptualisation of the product design and the 
manufacturing process, and also concerns  product branding and eventual distribution 
channels. Successful implementation requires that certain conditions are met. First, there 
must be sufficient market de mand, and willingness to pay, for green products. This 
condition is likely to differ across jurisdictions; consumers in developing countries may 
have a limited ability to pay for products that are relatively expensive. Second, the bio -
based, renewable, or recovered material inputs that are adopted must be good substitutes 
for the traditional materials that they replace. They also need to be sufficiently available 
and affordable; firms are unlikely to adopt the circular supply business model where it 
significantly increases their cost of doing business or risk profile.   
2.2.2. Resource recovery models 
Resource recovery business models involve the production of secondary raw materials 
from waste streams. There are three main activities involved, each of which is typ ically 
undertaken by different market actors (Gaillochet and Chalmin, 2009 [7]). As its name 
suggests, collection involves the collection of the waste materials generated by 
households, businesses, and  industry; it is generally organised by local governments. 
Sorting involves separation of a particular waste stream into its constituent materials; in 
some cases it is undertaken in public facilities and in others by the private sector. 
Secondary production involves the transformation of sorted waste material back into 
finished raw materials; it is generally undertaken by firms operating in the private sector. 
The resulting secondary raw materials – metals, plastics, paper, etc – are then  sold to 
various manufacturing firms. 
The business case underlying resource recovery models centres on the valorisation of the 
materials contained in waste streams. Raw waste is available at little or no cost; indeed 
the households and firms that generate it are often willing to pay to have it taken away. At 
the same time, finished secondary raw materials fetch significant prices on commodity 
markets. The challenge for firms adopting the resource recovery model is in ensuring that",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,28
"28 │ 2. CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
the unit cost of undertaki ng this valorisation process is sufficiently small relative to the 
market price of finished materials. 
Adoption of the resource recovery business model is only likely under certain conditions. 
First, there needs to be a market for secondary raw materials. Concerns about the quality 
or composition of these materials mean that this is not always the case. Some 
technologically advanced sectors (aerospace for example) tend to avoid recovered 
materials because of uncertainty about their performance characteristi cs in extreme 
conditions. Similarly, food packaging providers in some countries are unable to use 
recovered plastics and paper due to hazardous chemicals regulation. Second, adoption of 
the business model requires that a sufficient volume of waste material  being generated. 
This is not always the case, especially in regions characterised by low population 
densities or low levels of consumption. Although the transport of waste to central 
processing facilities is technically possible, it is not always economic ally feasible given 
the bulky and low value character of many waste streams. 
The resource recovery business model, or recycling as it is better known, has several 
variants, each of which is described below: 
Downcycling 
Like recycling, downcycling involves the transformation of waste into secondary raw 
materials. The key difference is that the recovered materials are of an inferior quality, and 
can only be used as an input in a limited subset of applications. For example, in the 
context of paper and cardboar d recycling, each additional loop results in a reduction of 
the length of cellulose fibres. As a result, recovered paper cannot always be used for the 
same applications that virgin paper can.  
Upcycling 
Upcycling is the opposite of downcycling. It involves  the transformation of waste into 
secondary raw materials, and their subsequent use in relatively high value applications. 
An illustrative example is undertaken by Freitag, a German apparel manufacturer,  that 
produces bags made from truck tarps, car seat b elts, and bicycle inner tubes (see Annex 
1). 
Industrial symbiosis 
Industrial symbiosis, or closed loop recycling as it is sometimes called, involves the use 
of production by -products from one firm as production inputs by another (Achterberg, 
Hinfelaar and Bocken, 2016 [2]). Relative to classical recycling, there is more of an 
emphasis on commercial and industrial waste streams and, at the same time, fewer 
intermediate actors involved in material transfor mation. Industrial symbiosis is most 
common in industries that produce very pure and homogeneous material flows, such as 
the chemical industry. Some of these tight relationships develop organically. Most often, 
however, they are the result of carefully pla nned industrial parks that connect one firm 
with another via pipelines or short -distance truck deliveries (Taranic, Behrens and Topi, 
2016[8]). 
2.2.3. Product life extension models 
As their name suggests, pr oduct life extension models involve extending the life of 
products. This is desirable from a circular economy perspective because products, and the",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,29
"2. CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS │ 29 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
materials embedded in them, remain in the economy for longer, and thereby potentially 
reduce the extraction of new resources. There are three mechanisms involved. First, 
manufacturers can extend the service life of their products by designing them in a way 
that increases durability. This is referred to as the classic long life model in the remainder 
of this repo rt. Second, reuse and repair activities, and their associated business models, 
ensure that products actually attain their intended service life (rather than being 
prematurely discarded). Third, remanufacturing extends the life of products by “resetting 
the clock” – remanufactured products attain an entirely new service life. Each of these 
business model sub-types is summarised in Table 2.2 and discussed briefly below. 
Table 2.2. Overview of product life extension models 
  Key characteristic Business case

Manufacturers can charge a premium for higher quality, more 
durable products 
Direct reuse

products that would have otherwise been

(whether online platforms or physical shops) can charge a

Maintenance  
and repair 
By fixing or replacing defective 
components, maintenance and repair 
allows degraded products to reach their 
full expected life. 
For original equipment manufacturers, extending product care 
beyond the point of sale may help to promote customer 
loyalty. In addition, repairing existing products can be a 
profitable activity for third party repair firms. 
Refurbishment 
and  
remanufacturing 
Gives products a ""new life"" by restoring 
them to their original working condition 
Refurbished or remanufactured products are sold at a lower 
price than new ones, but may generate higher profit margins 
due to material cost savings 
 
With the exception of the classic long life model, it is not necessarily the case that 
product life extension models are undertaken by the original equipment manufacturer 
(OEM). In many cases, it is actually third party operators that facilitate the reuse of 
second-hand goods, or carry out repair, refurbishment, or remanufacturing activities. The 
business case varies accordingly. For third party adopters, offering repair, refurbishment, 
or remanufacturing services is about leveraging the cost savings associ ated with using 
already existing materials and products as inputs. These activities produce products of a 
similar quality to new equivalents, but at a considerably lower cost. For original 
equipment manufacturers, the decision to adopt life extension activ ities probably rests 
upon two additional considerations. First, adoption is a strategic way of addressing the 
threat from third party firms and may foster greater customer loyalty (Long et  al., 
2017[9]). Second, in the case of remanufacturing, adoption can partially mitigate 
procurement risks associated with key material inputs.  
Classic long life  
As discussed above, the classic long life model involves designing products with longer 
service lives. The business case for adoption is similar to that for circular supply models; 
firms that produce higher quality products have an ability to charge customers higher 
prices. Essentially, low sales volumes are offset by a premium pricing strategy.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,30
"30 │ 2. CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
Direct reuse 
In many cases, products are not disposed of because they have reached the end of their 
(functional) life, but because consumers decide to replace them with updated versions. 
For example, Cooper (2004[10]) finds that around one third of appliances in the UK are 
still in working order when thrown away. The direct reuse business model takes 
advantage of this by facilitating the redistribution of used products to new owners. In this 
way, products that wou ld have otherwise been disposed of continue to remain in 
circulation.  
Direct reuse is not usually facilitated by the original manufacturer, but by a third -party 
who distributes goods that already exist in the economy. In this context, internet reselling 
platforms such as eBay and Craigslist have gradually tapped into the market and are 
competing with more traditional second -hand shops and bulletin boards (Lacy and 
Rutqvist, 2015 [5]). Because profit is usually made via a small margin of the reselling 
price, the residual value of the product should be high enough for reselling. It is, 
therefore, important that the product is not severely damaged and generally in good 
condition. A challenging aspect of thi s model is to reach a critical mass of sellers/donors 
and buyers to make the platform attractive.  
Maintenance and repair 
By fixing or replacing defective components, product maintenance and repair ensures that 
products reach their full expected service li fe. In this way, degraded products that would 
otherwise have been discarded of and replaced continue to remain in circulation. This is 
no small issue; research undertaken by WRAP (2011[11]) finds that 23% of the electronic 
equipment discarded in the UK could be reused or resold with minor or moderate repair. 
Fairphone, a smartphone manufacturer, is one example of a firm attempting to address 
this issue. By incorporating greater modularity into the de sign of their smartphones, 
Fairphone facilitates the repair of existing products and reduces demand for new 
equivalents.  
Maintenance and repair is carried out by both original equipment manufacturers (such as 
Fairphone) and by third party firms (such as i Mend or Mister Minit). For original 
manufacturers, a major benefit of integrating service components to the value proposition 
of a physical product is the high-quality branding and customer trust that it affords. 
Selling the same product at a price premium is also conceivable from a marketing point of 
view. Through potential multiple points of contact between the seller and buyer after the 
initial sale, there is furthermore a chance to build up higher brand loyalty, especially 
when customer experience has been positive (Bocken et al., 2016[12]). 
Refurbishment and remanufacturing 
Refurbishment and remanufacturing involve the restoration of degraded products, either 
for a fee, or for subsequent resale to o riginal or new owners. In refurbishment, the 
emphasis is largely on aesthetic improvements, with limited restoration of product 
functionality (Spelman and Sheerman, 2014 [13]). Remanufacturing, by contr ast, is a 
broader concept that involves the restoration of used products to their original level of 
functionality (Box 2.1).  As such, despite  the usually lower sales price, remanufactured 
products are usually labelled “as good as new” (Parker et al., 2015[14]). Remanufacturing 
is usually carried out by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), which has the both 
the technical expertise and the appropriate components to allow product performance to 
be fully restored.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,31
"2. CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS │ 31 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
 
 
Remanufacturing can be a profitable business model; it has been adopted by an increasing 
number of multinationals worldwide. Its earning model is based upon generating 
additional revenue by reselling the same or similar products multiple times. Moreover, 
cost savings can be achieved by reducing the amount of virgin material and components 
being sourced. Often, a remanufactured product is 40% less expensiv e than a newly 
manufactured one (Le Moigne and Georgeault, 2016 [15]). In times of highly volatile 
natural resource prices, this may lead to a reduced sourcing risk. The successful and 
profitable integration of an in -house remanufacturing capacity requires several factors to 
be in place, such as dedicated factory facilities, a specialized workforce, and a 
sophisticated reverse logistics  system. Although remanufactured goods are usually 
cheaper than newly  manufactured ones, they often come with a comparable quality 
standard and warranty which makes them an interesting alternative for customers. 
Products suited for the remanufacturing model are mostly capital intensive and durable. 
They should have long product life cycles and a modular design for easy disassembly and 
repair in order to be economically viable. Annex 1 provides a case example for heavy 
machinery manufacturer Caterpillar. 
2.2.4. Sharing models 
Sharing models, or sharing economy or sharing platform mo dels as they are sometimes 
called, involve using under -utilised consumer assets more intensively, either through 
lending or pooling (Box 2.2). There are a variety of products that sit unused for much of 
their effective life; housing, vehicles, clothing, and tools are some examples. Research by 
the Ellen McArthur Foundation finds that the average European vehicle is parked 92% of 
the time and that, even when it is in use, only 1.5 of the available 5 seats are typically 
used (Ellen McArthur Foundation, 2015 [16]). Sharing of these products has always taken 
place, but has become more widespread in recent years as the phenomenon of “sharing 
between strangers” has emerged. This has largely resulted from the em ergence of various 
technologies – the internet, mobile phone technology, and the development of referral and 
reputational systems – that have reduced the transaction costs and risks associated with 
sharing assets.  
Box 2.1. The definition of remanufacturing used in this report 
According to the European Remanufacturing Network (Parker et  al., 2015[14]), the only 
definition for remanufacturing that is recognised as a national standard is that produced 
by th e British Standards Institution. BS 8887 -2 states that remanufacturing involves 
“returning a product to at least its original performance with a warranty that is equivalent 
or better than that of new, newly manufactured product”. Supplementary notes to thi s 
definition state that remanufacturing involves the dismantling of products, restoring and 
replacing components, and testing individual parts and the whole product to ensure it fits 
within the original design specifications. It is this process that ensure s that 
remanufactured products have at least the same performance level as the original new 
product.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,32

Most of today’s sharing practices are fac ilitated by online platforms, some of which – 
Airbnb for example – have become powerful market actors. Sharing models have two 
sub-types: co-ownership and co -access. The underlying business case for both is clear. 
Online platforms facilitate transactions b etween the owners of under -utilised assets and 
individuals seeking to use them; platform owners can generate a small margin on each 
related transaction. Significantly, because the capital cost of the underlying goods has 
already been paid (by owners), the up-front investment cost required to launch an online 
platform is significantly smaller than that required to become a traditional provider. 
Platforms usually also have very small operational costs and significant potential for scale 
up.   
For the owners o f under-utilised assets and products, the emergence of online platforms 
provides an opportunity to earn additional income. Unused apartments, rooms, vehicles, 
vehicle seats, clothing, or tools can be leveraged, rather than sitting idle. Potential buyers 
also benefit to the extent that shared products are cheaper than their traditional 
equivalents. For example, one reason why accommodation sharing has performed so 
strongly in recent years is because it is often available at a price discount to traditional 
hotel rooms. Several recent assessments find that the average price of an Airbnb listing 
was between 15% and 20% lower than a traditional hotel equivalent (STR, 2017 [17]; 
Statista, 2017[18]). 
 
Box 2.2. The definition of sharing models used in this report 
There are widely diverging views about what activities sharing models encompass. This 
is partially a consequence of the use of the key enabling technology – online platforms – 
in a number of other closely related business models. The definition of sharing models 
used in this report follows that developed by Frenken and Schor (2017[19]), who describe 
the activities involved as “consumers granting each other temporary access to under -
utilized physical assets, possibly for money”. In this view, sharing models have three key 
aspects: 
 They involve peer to peer or, alternatively, consumer to consumer (C2C) 
transactions. Transactions that involve renting or leasing products from firms are 
separate since, in many cases, they would considered as product service system 
business models (consider urban car sharing schemes such as Autolib or the 
leasing of idle industrial capacity for example). 
 They involve the temporary, rather than permanent transfer of product o wnership. 
Online platforms that facilitate the sale and purchase of second hand goods would 
be considered to fall under product life extension business models (consider EBay 
for example). 
 They involve the more efficient use of under -utilised physical asset s, rather than 
services provided by private individuals. Online platforms that facilitate the 
service transactions between individuals are examples of on -demand business 
models (consider Uber or Task Rabbit). 
Focusing on the business activities facilitated  by online platforms, rather than the 
platforms themselves, has two main advantages. First, not all of the business activities 
that utilise online platforms necessarily have the potential to improve material efficiency",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,33

Co-ownership 
The co-ownership variant of s haring models involves the lending of physical goods. The 
sharing of household tools and appliances on platforms like Peerby is one such example. 
Products that are especially suited for the co -ownership model are capital intensive, 
infrequently used, and have a low ownership rate (IDDRI, 2014[20]). Moreover, they must 
be eas y to transport and should be durable, in order to allow for the increased usage 
during their effective lifespan.  Urban areas are particularly suited to co -ownership 
models; high population densities reduce the transaction costs associated with a 
temporary change in product ownership (IDDRI, 2014[20]). Annex 1 provides examples of 
several sharing models.  
Co-access 
The co -access variant of sharing models involves allowing others to take part in an 
activity that would have taken place anyway. Thus, carpooling allows seats that would 
otherwise have remained empty to be occupied during a particular journey. Blablacar is a 
prominent example of this business model. Though its online platform, it links drivers 
intending to undertake long journeys with passengers that are willing to pay for a spare 
seat. 
2.2.5. Product service systems models 
Product service system (PSS) models combine a physical product with a service 
component. There are several variations, some of which place more emphasis on the 
physical product, and others that focus more on the service aspect. The typology used in 
this re port follows that developed by Tukker (2004[21]). It separates product service 
system models into three main variants: product -oriented, user -oriented, and result -
oriented PSS models. Each of these is briefly discussed below. 
Product-oriented product service system models 
Product-oriented PSS systems are focused mostly on the product end  of the PSS 
spectrum. Manufacturing firms that adopt this business model continue to produce and 
sell products in a conventional way, but include additional after-sales service in the value 
proposition. Services may, for instance, take the form of maintenance contracts and repair 
offerings through extended product warranties or take back agreements (COWI, 2008[22]). 
For example, the high -end outdoor clothing company Patagonia guarantees to repair 
broken apparel and operates a platform for customers to sell their products as second -
hand products.  
or stimulate a transition to a more circular economy. Consider the migration of traditional 
retail sales to online platforms such as Amazon or the emergence of on -demand services 
platforms such as Uber for example. Second, the regulatory issues relating to online 
platforms differ considerably  according to the specific business activities involved. 
Consider the distinction between B2C and C2C transactions and questions about who is, 
and is not, considered to be a producer for tax (and other) purposes.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,34

User-oriented product service system models 
User-oriented (or access-oriented as they are sometimes called) PSS models put products 
and services on a more balanced  footing. Customers pay for temporary access to a 
particular product, typically through a short - or long -term l ease agreement, while the 
service provider retains full ownership of the product. Urban car sharing schemes, office 
equipment leases, and garment rental services are widely cited examples of user -oriented 
PSS models. Another rapidly emerging example concer ns the digitalisation of various 
forms of traditional media.2 Online platforms like Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, and Coursera 
allow literature, film, music, and education to be consumed without ownership of the 
underlying books, CDs, DVDs etc. 
User-oriented PSS models provide access to the services associated with a particular good 
without ownership of the good itself. That means that consumers only pay for a product 
when they actually need it; the upfront and ongoing costs of ownership are largely 
avoided.3 In the case of urban car sharing schemes, customers can temporarily use a 
vehicle without having to bear the associated running, maintenance, and parking costs. In 
addition, user -oriented PSS models can also provide consumers with access to high 
quality or technologically advanced products that they could not otherwise afford. One 
example concerns clothing; it is common for individuals to lease, rather than own, some 
types of expensive garments. 
Adopting a user -oriented PSS models can create various opportun ities for firms. By 
retaining ownership of products, and the components and materials embedded in them, 
manufacturers can potentially mitigate a range of supply chain risks (access to, and price 
volatility of, material inputs for example). This is likely t o be an important driver of 
business model adoption in certain situations (such as where the security of supply of key 
manufacturing inputs is uncertain), but not in others (such as where the business model is 
adopted by third party, non-manufacturing firms). In the latter case, the adoption of user -
oriented PSS is probably motivated by a different set of opportunities. For example, for 
expensive goods such as vehicles and high -end clothing, there may be value in targeting 
consumers who are unable or unwill ing to purchase new products, but who may be 
interested in paying for temporary access to them. Similarly, providing goods like 
literature and music digitally can reduce unit production costs while also increasing 
revenues (through the ability to sell advertising on the associated online platform). 
Result-oriented product service system models 
Result-oriented PSS models are situated at the service end of the PSS spectrum. Instead 
of marketing manufactured assets or goods in a traditional way, adopting firms market the 
services or outcomes provided by these goods. For example, an adopting firm might sell a 
heating outcome (maintaining a certain temperature level within a building), rather than 
the underlying heating equipment or energy inputs. Alternatively, an adopting firm may 
undertake the manufacturing of a particular brand’s products rather than selling the 
capital equipment itself.4 Essentially, contracts between suppliers and customers therefore 
describe a specific outcome, without necessarily specifying the means through which it is 
achieved (COWI, 2008[22]). This creates strong incentives for the efficient use of variable 
(and potentially polluting) inputs such as energy or chemicals. Result -oriented PSS 
models have been adopted in a range of sectors; US EPA (2017[23])gives the following 
three examples: 
Energy service companies  (ESCOs) offer energy efficiency and related services to their 
customers by assuming full performance risk for the project and products used. The level",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,35
"2. CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS │ 35

of compensation is tied closely to the energy efficiency savings they are able to 
accomplish. An example is the Dutch lighting company Philips which introduced 
‘Circular Lighting’ or ‘pay -per-lux’ back in 2009. A client may agree with Philips on a 
specific level of brightness for a facility measured in lux. The task of Philips then is to 
provide the level of brightness with the most cost -effective lighting equipment possi ble 
(see additional details on this in annex 1).   
Chemical management services  (CMS) or chemical leasing aims at supplying and 
managing the customer’s chemicals. The business model emerged first in the late 1980s 
in the US and has resulted in many long -term contract relationships (OECD, 2017[24]). 
Similar to the case of ESCO’s, the compensation of the provider is linked to the quantity 
and quality of the service and not, as in traditional models, to the volume of the chemicals 
used. By taking full responsibility of the chemicals used, the providing firm will also be 
responsible for their handling at the end -of-life and have incentives to optimise these 
costs. 
Integrated pest management (IPM) and performance based pest management (PPMS) is a 
special form of chemical leasing in the agricultural sector. The chemicals used for pest 
control are owned and handled by the providing company which possesses expertise 
about their optimal application. The com pensation is not based on the chemical volumes 
sold, but on the level of crop loss prevented. 
2.3. Drivers of circular business model adoption more generally 
The business case for the adoption of circular business models is not static, but varies 
according to a  broad set of societal level factors. Changes in consumer behaviour, the 
threat of new regulation, or concerns about the stability of key supply chains represent 
considerable business risks for firms operating traditional business models, and can 
stimulate switching towards greener, more circular modes of production. In a similar way, 
the appearance of new technologies can reduce the cost structure of relatively circular 
production, thereby creating opportunities for potential adopters. The following sectio n 
presents a brief snapshot of the factors that are facilitating the adoption of circular 
business models. 
2.3.1. Traditional “linear” modes of production: emerging business risks 
Regulatory risk is becoming a significant concern for firms that operate traditiona l 
business models. One example concerns the emerging prospect of more widespread and 
stringent carbon pricing. This probably partly explains the broader adoption of internal 
shadow carbon pricing within the private sector (CDP, 2016[25]), and the diversification of 
some fossil fuel producers into renewable electricity technologies  (Climate Home, 
2016[26]). Another example concerns the potential intr oduction of more stringent product 
design and material recovery standards in various countries. The recent adoption of bans 
of certain products made from plastic (e.g. such as single carrier plastic bag bans) in a 
number of countries, as well as the recent  European Union strategy on plastics are such 
examples (European Commission, 2018[27]), and probably represents a significant risk for 
firms whose products rely heavily on virgin plastic inputs. 
Many e merging renewable energy and information communication technologies are 
heavily reliant on materials that are geographically concentrated in a handful of countries. 
More than 80% of the global production of rare earth elements – a key input in several 
renewable energy technologies – takes place in China (USGS, 2016[28]). Similarly, about",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,36

half of global cobalt production – a key input in smartphone, laptop, and automotive 
batteries – takes place in the D emocratic Republic of Congo. For the firms that 
manufacture these products, geo -politically related supply chain disruptions are an 
important operational risk, but one that can be partially mitigated by the adoption of the 
circular supply, resource recovery, or product service system models. 
Heightened consumer awareness is creating new sources of reputational risk for 
established firms. Concerns about human rights abuses, dangerous working conditions, 
financing conflict have existed in the jewellery and cl othing sectors for many years, and 
have led to a proliferation of labelling schemes intended to differentiate ethically 
produced products from otherwise. In the environmental sphere, similar concerns – about 
global warming, plastics pollution and biodivers ity loss among others – may be creating 
new impetus for the adoption of greener or more circular modes of production. The recent 
pledges made  by eleven leading consumer goods firms (including Coca Cola, Unilever, 
and L’Oréal) to use 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable packaging by 2025 (Ellen 
McArthur Foundation, 2018[29]) may partially reflect this issue.5 
2.3.2. Emerging technologies as a driver for the adoption of more circular 
modes of production 
The appearance and diffusion of new technologies has also been an important factor in 
the evolution and growth of circular business models. The emergence of the internet and 
the widespread uptake of digital devices have been particularly important. First, increased 
connectivity has reduced the transaction costs and risk associated with sharing goods, and 
increased the convenience of leasing rather than owning goods. Second, connectivity has 
allowed, in combination with smart sensor technology, real time mon itoring of product 
performance, which is probably facilitating certain types of product service system. 
Third, connectivity has allowed, in combination with digitalisation, a variety of consumer 
products to be significantly dematerialised. In addition to t he content related goods 
described above, digitalisation has also affected education (though the growth of so -
called massive open online courses) and work travel (through the emergence of 
teleconferencing). 
Improvements in more traditional production techn ologies have also improved the 
business case for some circular business models. In the case of the circular supply model, 
the rapid improvements in solar and wind generation technologies are well documented, 
and have allowed renewable facilities to become increasingly competitive with their fossil 
fuel based equivalents. In the case of the resource recovery  business model, the 
emergence of mechanised material sorting facilities (MRFs) has significantly improved 
the separation of different waste streams, the reby reducing the cost of secondary material 
production. In the case of the repair and remanufacturing business models, improvements 
in sensor technology have allowed faults to be diagnosed relatively quickly, again 
improving the underlying business case. 
Technological change is also creating a variety of risks in the context of resource use and 
environmental pressure. The emergence and diffusion of a variety of labour saving 
technologies – ranging from robotics in production to snow movers and leaf blowers  in 
consumption – may have actually increased the environmental footprint of some 
activities. In addition, rebound effects, which are discussed further in Section 4.4 , have 
probably offset at least some of the reduction s in resource extraction that have be en 
realised by efficiency improvements. Finally, the continued growth of green technologies 
may be shifting the environmental burden associated with resource extraction and use",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,37

away from the atmosphere (in the form greenhouse gas and sulphur and nitrogen o xide 
emissions for example) towards water and land. The extraction and processing of the 
aluminium, copper, lithium, and rare earth elements used widely in the automotive, 
energy, and ICT sectors has a variety of often toxic by -products such as mine waste,  
process tailings, and smelter residues.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,38

Notes
 
1  Circular supply models are also often said to facilitate an economy that is “regenerative by 
design”. 
2  This is perhaps an example of a hybrid circular business model. In many cases, it involves 
short-term access to, rather than ownership of, goods and services; a key characteristic of result -
based PSS models (e.g. Spotify or Netflix). In other cases, it is no more than a traditional sales 
model, but with transactions of digital rather than physical produ cts (e.g., e -books or digital 
newspaper subscriptions).  
3  That said, ownership of electronic devices is normally required for consumers to 
participate in these product offerings (Netflix and Spotify for example).  
4  MakeTime, a United States based online  platform, facilitates the procurement of precision 
manufactured parts by connecting product assembers (the client) with upstream production 
facilities (the supplier). 
5  Coca Cola has also pledged to, (i) collect and recycle the same volume of packaging that it 
produces, and (ii) incorporate 50% recycled content in to new packaging (both by 2030) (Coca 
Cola, 2018[144]).

Chapter 3.  The current scale and potential scalability of circular business 
models 
This chapter moves from describing different circular business models to assessing their 
potential scalability. Each of the headline business models considered in this report is 
analysed in terms of, i) their current market share, and ii) their ability to significantly 
scale up. The former draws upon existing market data from a variety of sources, while the 
latter is based on a review of the literature relating to these business models. The chapter 
concludes by summarising the current market penetration of circular business models, 
and by identifying several fundamental barriers to their future adoption.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,42

3.1. Introduction 
This chapter moves from describing different circular business models to assessing their 
potential scalability. Scalability is important. Achieving a genuine transition to a more 
circular economy – with significant decoupling of economic growth from natural resource 
extraction and use – will be unlikely if circular business models continue to occupy small 
economic niches in a limited number of countries.  
Most of the circular business models identified in Chapter 2 are not new. The resource 
recovery and product life extension business models have existed in the form of 
recycling, re-use, and repair for many millennia. As will be shown in this chapter, these 
activities are relatively mature in most sectors; the key question is therefore what kinds of 
technological, policy, or behavioural change could stimulate more widespread adop tion. 
Other circular business models are emerging rapidly in response to one or more 
underlying drivers. In the case of the circular supplies business model, increased 
environmental awareness along with a higher willingness to pay for green products seem 
to have been important. In the case of sharing business models, the availability of the 
internet, and the development of referral and reputational systems, have been key drivers. 
For these business models, the key questions are, (i) whether continued scale up is 
feasible once significant market share is attained, and (ii) whether they are potentially 
applicable to sectors other than those currently involved (e.g., how much potential do 
sharing models have beyond the accommodation sector?).   
The current scal e, and potential scalability, of individual business models and business 
model sub -types will vary according to the economic sector considered. Potential 
scalability of a particular business model will also vary according to the extent that 
related business models have already emerged. In some cases, this will involve synergies. 
The adoption of PSS business models will tend to provide manufacturers with incentives 
to design more modular and recyclable products, with clear benefits for material recovery 
activities further downstream. In other cases, there will be trade -offs; widespread 
investment in material recovery facilities may increase demand for secondary raw 
materials to the point where product repair or remanufacturing becomes less attractive. 
Assessing the scalability of all business models in all sectors, and the interactions 
between them, is beyond the scope of this work. This chapter aims to provide insights 
through the use of four key examples: recycling in the metals sector, product 
remanufacturing, sharing in short term accommodation sector, and product service 
systems in the transport sector.  
Predicting the market penetration of a particular business model beyond the immediate 
future is a necessarily subjective exercise. Business model adoption will be driven by the 
attractiveness of the underlying business case which, in turn, will depend on the evolution 
of an array of technological, policy, and behavioural factors. The approach taken in this 
chapter is to document current rates of market penetration and then, on the basis of the 
respective business model characteristics and the existence of any fundamental barriers to 
scale up, develop a view of potential future scalability.

steel, aluminium, copper (Figure 3.1). This figure has fluctuated over the last 50 years, but 
with a notable recent decline for steel and aluminium, and an equally notable increase for 
copper. For less common, but nonetheless strategically important metals such as lithium 
and the group of rare earth elements, secondary production accounts for a negligible share 
of total output (UNEP, 2013[1]). Although this situation may be slowly changing with the 
recent increase in demand for these materials, there rema ins little data available. Given 
the low market share of secondary metal producers, there seems to be considerable 
potential for the scale up of the resource recovery business model in the metal sector. A 
similar conclusion could probably be drawn for othe r recyclable commodities with 
similarly limited market shares (plastics and paper for example).

3.2.2. Future scalability 
One fundamental constraint on the scalability of the resource recovery business model is 
the limited availability of scrap feedstock at a given point in time. In contrast to the 
primary metal production, where additional demand can be reliably met through the 
exploitation of known ore reserves, the amount of scrap available for processing each 
year is constrained, both by the decommissioning of long lived capital goods (e.g. 
buildings and vehicles), and by the disposal of short lived consumer goods (e.g. food 
packaging). In practice, this means that, even if recycling rates for a particular metal did 
approach 100%, it is unlikely that secondary production could satisfy more than half of 
total metal demand in the foreseeable  future. This issue is currently most relevant for 
steel, where global recycling rates are thought to be around 80% (UNEP, 2013[1]), while 
the proportion of secondary output in total production is only around 25% (Figure 3.1).1 
For the vast majority of other metals, recycling rates are typically lower than 25% 
(UNEP, 2013[1]), and it is a lack of economic competitiveness that currently holds back

the resource recovery business model. Producing finished metal products from recycled 
scrap is not cost competitive with doing so from virgin mineral ores. There are a number 
of underlying reasons for this, ranging from the labour intensity of product disassembly, 
sorting, and recycling on the supply side, to concerns about the performance of secondary 
materials in high performance applications on the d emand side. Market failures and 
policy misalignments are also important; one example of the latter concerns the 
government support that is provided to extractive and processing industries in a number 
of countries (OECD, 2017 [5]). These issues hold back the development of well -
functioning and liquid secondary materials markets, and this in itself has negative 
implications for secondary competitiveness (both by hindering the realisation of scale 
economies in production, and by contributing to the relatively high price volatility 
(Figure 3.2) that restricts investment in secondary production capacity.

The global market for remanufactured goods is thought to be worth around €100 billion 
(Le Moigne and Georgeault, 2016 [7]; AmCham, 2017 [8]). Data from the United States

remanufacturing economy in 2011, with around USD 43 billion in remanufactured output

(US ITC, 2012[9]). Production data is also available for the European Union (Parker et al., 
2015[10]) and China (Wang, 2016[11]), which in 2015 produced EUR 30 billion and CNY 
150 billion (EUR 20 billion) of remanufactured goods respectively.  
Remanufacturing remains relatively small in terms of its share of total manufacturing. In 
both the EU and the US, remanufacturing generally accounts for no more than 4% of the 
output from any given sector ( Table 3.1 and Table 3.2). One exception involves the 
European aerospace industry, where remanufacturing apparently represents 11% of total 
sectoral output. Part of the reason for this appears to be that general repa ir services have 
been lumped to together with remanufacturing. 2 More generally, it is apparent from the 
US and EU data that remanufacturing is better established in some sectors – aerospace, 
heavy duty and off -road equipment, medical equipment, and tyres – than in others – 
consumer products, EEE, and IT products. This is consistent with more anecdotal 
evidence regarding remanufacturing; the examples that are frequently cited include 
Caterpillar (heavy duty and off -road equipment), Siemens (medical imaging e quipment), 
and Michelin (tyres).

3.3.2. Future scalability 
Given the low share of remanufacturing in total manufacturing output, there appears to 
remain considerable potential for future scale up. Although there is limited data available, 
remanufactured output does seem to have grown in recent years. In the US, fo r instance, 
remanufacturing expanded at 7% annually between 2009 and 2011 (US ITC, 2012 [9]). 
Projections for the EU suggest that remanufactured output could double or triple during 
the next decade, per haps employing as many as 600 000 workers by 2030 (Parker et al., 
2015[10]). Achieving these projections will require that a number of important barriers to 
the further development of remanufacturing be addressed. 
There does not appear to be any inherent characteristic of remanufacturing that might 
limit its future growth. Achieving significantly higher rates of market penetration will 
instead depend on the attractiveness of the underlying business case. Although there are a 
number of assessments that highlight the theoretical profitability of remanufacturing 
(Lavery et  al., 2013 [12]),3 it is clear that it continues to be largely uneconomic under 
current market conditions. Two key costs that are often highlighted are those related to 
labour inputs and the transport of used cores. With respect to the former, it is generally 
accepted that remanufacturing, because it cannot be automated to the same exte nt as 
traditional manufacturing, is relatively labour intensive. While this is positive from a job 
creation perspective, the additional costs involved also represent a barrier to market 
penetration. With respect to core transport, it has been noted that re strictions on cross 
border flows of used and second -hand products can make it difficult for remanufacturing 
firms to regain access to their products.  
More broadly, it is possible that many traditional manufacturers may be unwilling to 
adopt remanufacturin g, even when external calculations seem to indicate that it makes 
economic sense. There are at least three reasons.  
 There may be concerns about product cannibalisation  (Agrawal, Atasu and van 
Ittersum, 20 15[13]). Many traditional manufacturing firms market a suite of 
products within a given product category, often ranging from entry level versions 
with limited functionality to high end versions with more functionality. It may be 
that sales of remanufactured products – necessarily priced at levels below those of 
premium products – displace sales of traditionally manufactured premium 
products, thereby reducing overall profits.  
 Manufacturers may be unable to capture all of the value associated with designing 
products that are amenable to remanufacturing (those that are relatively modular 
and easily disassembled). For example, the entry of low -cost third party repair, 
refurbishment, and remanufacturing firms can mean that end of use products do 
not find th eir way back to the original equipment manufacturer. This lack of 
certainty reduces the attractiveness of adopting remanufacturing.  
 Although remanufacturing produces products that are “as good as new”, it does 
not necessarily follow that consumers are wil ling to pay “new”, or even “near -
new” prices for them. In some cases, this is because the performance of the 
remanufactured product is not as good as that for a contemporary version of the 
same product, even if it is as good as that for the original versio n. In other cases, 
prices are probably lower because consumers are unprepared to pay for a product 
that is perceived as being as old or out of fashion. This may be a partial",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,47

explanation for why remanufacturing appears to be less common in consumer 
goods sectors (personal electronics for example) than in B2B applications. 
3.4. Sharing models: the example of short-term lodging 
3.4.1. Current market penetration 
Airbnb is perhaps the best known platform for marketing short term lodging. It was 
founded in 2008 and has experienced exponential growth since. 4 By November 2016, 
Airbnb had around 1 million individual listings, giving it roughly the same capacity as the 
largest traditional hotel providers (STR, 2017[14]).5 This growth can be largely attributed 
to the price competiveness of Airbnb relative to traditional providers. According to 
several recent assessments, the average price of an Airbnb listing was between 15% and 
20% lower than a traditional hotel equivalen t (STR, 2017[14]; Statista, 2017[15]). Figure 3.3 
shows the growth in annual Airbnb guest arrivals (or individual bookings – regardless of 
their length) between 2008 and 2016. 
Although Airbnb’s growth has been dramatic, its relative share of  overall bookings 
remains small. Recent analysis indicates that it only accounts for 1 -6% of short stays in a 
cross section of ten major North American and European cities (STR, 2017[14]). Similarly, 
CBRE Hotels estimates that Airbnb hosts in New York generated $450 million in revenue 
for the year ended September 2015, only around 5% of the $9 billion in lodging revenue 
generated in the city that year (Travel Weekly, 2016 [16]). Given these figures, there 
appears to be clear potential for the continued scale up of sharing models in the short -
term lodging sector.

and elsewhere. That said, the availability of spare capacity and the introduc tion of 
additional regulatory restrictions represent barriers that could curtail scale up.  
In most cases, shortages of spare capacity are probably of limited relevance since there 
will always be a proportion of individuals unwilling to lease their assets.  Similarly, and 
particularly with respect to short term lodgement, it seems likely that there will always be 
a proportion of travellers who prefer the relative familiarity of traditional hotels. 
Preferences for traditional forms of consumption 6 also tend t o be reinforced by the 
transaction costs that are associated with participating in sharing business models. 
Sharing of existing assets introduces a variety of time costs – the search for an 
appropriate product, contacting the owner to arrange pick -up times, pick-up and return of 
the shared good – that can collectively render sharing less attractive unattractive. 
Importantly, both of these issues are likely to be partly mitigated if sharing models 
continue to emerge. Trust in platforms like Airbnb tends to increase as they become more 
widespread, and this may result in individuals becoming more willing to share their 
assets.7 Similarly, the transaction costs associated with asset sharing are likely to decrease 
as more people take part; increased participation increases the likelihood that an available 
asset is located nearby. These effects highlight the catalytic nature of sharing models, a 
feature that partly explains their rapid recent growth.  
Regulatory restrictions could represent a more significant barri er to the scale up of 
sharing models (Box 3.1). For example, in the context of short term lodging, a number of 
city authorities (in London, Amsterdam, and San Francisco among others) have placed a 
cap on the maximum number of nights that an Airbnb host can  offer each year (AirBnb, 
2018[18]). Authorities in other cities have imposed other restrictions. For example, in 
2015, city authorities in San Francisco made it illegal for hosts to offer short term leases 
for residences other than their primary address (San Francisco Business Portal, 2018 [19]). 
Similarly, authorities in New York have made short term (less than 30 days) sub -lets of 
any type illeg al unless the owner of the residence is living there during the time of the 
lease (The Herald, 2017 [20]). Although it is unclear how city rules will evolve in the 
future, it seems likely that any cont inued increase in stringency will affect the scale up of 
sharing models in the short term lodging segment.  
Figure 3.4 shows the reduction in Airbnb’s  year-on-year revenue growth in New York 
since 2011. 
 
 Box 3.1. Social concerns and the growth of sharing and other platform based business 
models 
The recent emergence of sharing (e.g., AirBnb) and other platform based business models 
(e.g., Uber and Amazon) has provided consumers with a number of clear benefits (in 
terms of financial savings, convenience, and product diversity). At the same time, the 
emergence of these business models has triggered concer ns about lost profitability and 
jobs in traditional service activities, foregone government tax revenues, and increasing 
housing prices and rents. 
The diversity of these business models, the speed at which they have emerged, and 
uncertainty about their cos ts and benefits has led to a fragmented policy response. Some",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,49

Although sharing models are currently most visible in the short term lodging segment, it 
is also relevant in other sectors. Analysis undertaken for France indicates that sharable 
goods – those characterised by high upfront costs and infrequent use – account for about 
25% of household expenditure (IDDRI, 2014[24]). The major product categories that are 
highlighted include vehicles, clothing, furnit ure, household appliances, and tools. 
Although there is little data available, and perhaps with the exception of vehicles, the 
practice of sharing these goods via online platforms is probably less widespread than it is 
for short term lodging. Clearly, the behavioural barriers highlighted above for lodging – 
the willingness of asset owners and leasers to participate in sharing – are relevant. 
Transaction costs may also be particularly important, especially for bulky goods like 
furniture which are difficult to transport even locally.

governments have taken a relatively “hands off” approach while others have intervened 
more strongly (see the above examples relating to AirBnb for example).  
At the centre of the debate lie conc erns about consumer protection and, relatedly, fair 
competition. Should “peer producers” of goods and services be regulated in the same way 
as traditional providers? Or do the reputational and referral systems embedded in most 
online platforms render certa in forms of traditional regulation no longer fit for purpose? 
To what extent should the incomes accruing to “peer producers” be subject to taxation – 
are there thresholds below which the administrative costs become excessive? The answers 
to these questions  are far from clear, but there is a significant body of ongoing research 
that will help to provide new insights. Interested readers may refer to the ongoing 
OECD’s Going Digital project and, more specifically, the work streams on online 
platforms in the co ntext of taxation (OECD, 2017[21]), regulation (OECD, 2018[22]), and 
consumer protection (OECD, 2016[23]).",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,50

3.5. Product service systems: the example of user oriented product service systems – 
mobility 
3.5.1. Current market penetration 
Urban bike and car sharing schemes are examples of user oriented product service 
systems. The underlying business model involves business to consumer (B2C) 
transactions and should not be confused with the consumer to consumer (C2C) 
transactions associated with car -pooling (e.g., BlaBlaCar) or bike (e.g., Peerby) or car 
sharing (e.g., Getaround). These mobility schemes are also distinct to traditional rental 
operations. First, rental locations are not limited to fixed locations such as airports, 
railway stations, and shops. Instead, bikes and vehicles can be accessed throughout urban 
areas with the use of GPS based mobile applications. Second, pricing schemes and typical 
usage patterns differ. Urban bike and car sharing schemes generally charge users an up -
front membership fee along with a variable fee based on the time (often minutes or hours) 
that the bike or vehicle is used for. Users have strong incentives to restrict usage to short 
periods, which partially explains why this type of sharing is primarily an  urban 
phenomenon. The following discussion focusses on urban car sharing schemes. Currently 
operating examples include Zipcar (privately owned and operated enterprise operating in 
the United States) and Autolib (government owned enterprise operating in Paris).  
Urban car sharing schemes have grown rapidly recent years (Figure 3.5). Between 2006 
and 2014, the global fleet of shared vehicles grew from 11 500 vehicles to 104 000 
vehicles while membership grew from 350 000 people to 4 800 000 people (Shaheen and 
Cohen, 2016[25]). That said, as of 2014, the fleet of shared vehicles accounted for less than 
0.1% of the almost 1 billion strong global in -use car fleet (OICA, 2015[26]). According to 
the same publication, the biggest markets for carsharing worldwide are Europe (46% of 
global members and 56% of global carsharing fleet) and North America (34% of global 
members and 23% of global fleet). In sum, the market p enetration of B2C car sharing 
schemes remains very low in cities in developed countries, and largely non -existent in 
cities in the developing world.

3.5.2. Future scalability 
There are no inherent characteristic s of urban car sharing schemes that will obviously 
hinder their continued emergence. 8 To the extent that the mobility provided by such 
schemes is comparable to that provided by alternative transport modes, both in terms of 
convenience and affordability, ca r sharing will probably continue to emerge and capture 
higher rates of market share. Projections developed by Navigant Research (2015[27]) 
indicate that global car sharing membership could reach 23 million people by 2024, a 
fivefold increased relative to today. The same projections suggest that much of the future 
growth will be seen in Asia, where car sharing has not developed to the same extent as in 
Europe and North America. At present, Asia, Africa, and Latin America comprise over 
78% of the world’s population, but only account for 20% of the car sharing market (WRI, 
2015[28]). Car sharing could help to prevent or delay the uptake of private car ownership 
of the growing middle-class in these regions.  
The future uptake of urban car sharing schemes will mostly depend on consumer 
acceptance of the concept, as well as the profitability of the underlying business model. 
With respect to the former, o ne potential barrier relates to the availability of parking 
space in public areas. The convenience of urban car sharing schemes is greatly 
diminished when it is difficult to find parking at the conclusion of the use period. Another 
barrier related to consumer acceptance is the value that individuals often appear to attach 
to vehicle ownership in itself. Private vehicles provide a mobility service – often one that 
is more convenient than shared vehicles – but they also seem to provide other sources of 
wellbeing. In particular, part of what individuals may be paying for when buying a 
vehicle is the status that comes with ownership. This is one explanation for why, despite 
providing much the same mobility service, there is a large price differential between mid-
range mass produced cars and high performance sports cars.9 If vehicles are a status good 
or, in other words, if individuals buy them for reasons other than the mobility service they 
provide, then this may become a significant obstacle to the continued emergence of urban 
mobility schemes.  
More generally, the suite of product service system business models – including product-
oriented, user -oriented, and result -oriented varieties – appear to be applicable in just 
about any market involving the use of manuf actured goods. As highlighted in Chapter 2, 
PSS models are already being applied in both B2B and B2C markets in sectors as diverse 
as apparel, aviation, chemicals, electronic appliances, energy, office furniture, and, of 
course, transport. They are also be ing applied increasingly in the context of digital 
products: e-books, streamed music, digital media, and online education for example.  
Despite this broad applicability (which is a significant strength from a scalability 
perspective), it is clear that the uptake of PSS business models continues to be rare in 
most sectors. There are probably two main reasons: 
 As emphasised by Tukker (2015[29]), B2C variants of PSS business models have 
historically been held back by a strong consumer desire for product ownership: 
“for consumers, having control over things, artefacts, and life itself is one of the 
most valued attributes”. This point about ownership is essentially the same as the 
one made above in the context of urban car sharing schemes.  
 It is not clear that PSS business models represent a better commercial strategy 
than traditional sales models. There probably are advantages in certain situations, 
such as where there is a considerable supply risk affect ing manufacturing inputs, 
or where the adoption of the PSS model allows manufacturers to signal the",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,52

superior quality of their product. But more generally, some costs can be higher, 
especially if the PSS introduces new labour inputs, or when it involves mor e 
networked production systems with associated transaction costs (Tukker, 
2015[29]). In addition, the management of ongoing client service relationships is 
unlikely to be within the core business exper tise of manufacturing firms, a factor 
that also probably hinders adoption. 
3.6. Conclusions 
Circular business models occupy a peripheral position in most markets ( Table 3.3). 
Recycled pulp and paper, metals, and plastics represent small proportions of global 
material output, while remanufactured industrial and consumer products represent an 
even smaller share of  global manufacturing. Sharing of under -utilised housing capacity 
has grown rapidly, but now only accounts for several percent of the annual short stays in 
most major cities. The same is true for user -oriented product service system models, 
which account for less than 1% of the market that they are perhaps most well known in: 
urban mobility. One notable exception to the above pattern is the emergence of result -
oriented PSS in the automotive market. European and North American vehicle 
manufacturers have wide ly outsourced the chemical coating phase of the production 
process on a price per-area basis (OECD, 2017[30]). 
Although this chapter did not include an explicit focus on geographic differences, it is 
apparent that some circular business models are more successful in certain contexts than 
others. In most cases, market penetration seems to have been greatest in developed 
country settings. Circular supply models, for example, have been successful here, perhaps 
because of a greater consumer ability to pay for “green” products. Similarly, sharing 
models involving short term lodging and transport have experienced rapid growth in 
wealthier cities, probably because of the relative availability of under-utilised assets there. 
There are also some notable exceptions. One example relates to certain forms of product 
sharing and leasing, which are becoming more visible in developing countries. Bike 
sharing schemes are common in large Chinese cities; more than two milli on shared bikes 
are available in Beijing alone (BBC, 2017 [31]). Another example concerns the resource 
recovery model. Trade data indicates that a significant portion of the material recovery 
value chai n (specifically the reprocessing of sorted waste back into secondary raw 
materials) is located in developing countries (Eurostat, 2018[32]). 
There remains considerable scope for the future growth of c ircular business models. 
However, any such growth will be subject to economic realities – more widespread 
adoption of these business models will not take place unless there is a solid underlying 
business case. In some cases, the attractiveness of the busin ess case may diminish as 
market share increases. For example, in the context of recycling, it is well documented 
that the unit cost of recovering steel or aluminium from household appliances is 
significantly higher than recovering them from relatively simp le bulky products like 
vehicle chassis’. In other cases, the attractiveness of the business case will improve as 
market share increases. This is especially relevant for those business models characterised 
by network effects; consumer acceptance of platform  models and car sharing schemes is 
likely to increase as the membership base – and services offered – grows. It may also be 
relevant for other business models that are characterised by some form of path 
dependence or that benefit in some way from the emergence of related business models.10

flows of product cores would allow remanufacturing to become more widespread and, 
perhaps, generate lower costs through either learning externalities or scale economies.11

As highlighted in Section 2.3, the business case for circular business models will also 
evolve alongside broader societal level trends. Changes in policy frameworks, consumer 
preferences, and available technologies have the potential to stimulate adoption in much 
the same way as in the past. 12 The emergence of technologies associated with the so -
called Fourth Industrial Revolution seems particularly promising in the context of circular 
business models. Improvements in robotics, artificial intelligence, sensor technology, and 
3D printing will have widespread consequences, particularly when coupled with 
increasingly pervasive digital networks. The Internet of Things (IoT), which is just one of 
the potential implications of these developments, will present an array of opportunities for 
more efficient food and energy use (Jagtap, 2017 [40]; Ashman, 2017 [41]). Research 
undertaken by the WEF (2016[42]) in New York city suggests that digital connectivity in 
concert with smart sensors could also vastly improve the convenience of ride sharing, to 
the extent that 80% of all journeys could be shared.  
Based on the material presented in this chapter, it is also possible to highlight several 
more fundamental barriers that affect the scalability of each major business model: 
 Resource recovery models  may become constrained by feedstock shortages if 
recycling rates approach 100%. At present, this is probably only relevant in the 
steel market, where global recycling rates are thought to be around 80%. Even if 
there was a business case for recycling the final 20% of scrap contained in waste 
flows, it is unlikely tha t secondary steel production could meet more than half of",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,54

global of global steel demand. This constraint may be eased in the long term as 
the materials contained in long lived capital goods and infrastructure are released 
into waste streams (assuming that future growth in demand for materials is 
sufficiently low). 
 More widespread adoption of the remanufacturing business model appears to be 
hindered by manufacturers’ concerns about cannabilisation of premium sales and 
the entry of third party remanufacturers . More generally, the limited market share 
held by the family of product life extension models – reuse, repair, refurbishment, 
and remanufacture – may be a result of a strong consumer desire for the “latest” 
product, an effect which is itself modulated by the rate of product innovation,. 
This is one explanation for why the remanufacturing business model has been 
more sucessful in a B2B than a B2C context. 
 Sharing models have emerged rapidly in response to several technological and 
social innovations, and wi ll probably continue to do so given the network effects 
that are inherent to these models. One obvious constraint to future growth is the 
availability of spare capacity, and the proportion of owners willing to make it 
available. Another issue concerns the longevity of current policy frameworks. In 
an effort to address equity and competitiveness concerns resulting from the 
growth of peer to peer sharing, policy makers in a number of cities have 
implemented new regulations (with respect to short term lodging for example) 
that may serve to slow scale up. 
 Product service system models have been adopted across a diverse range of 
sectors, and have seen some success in applications like chemical leasing (OECD, 
2017[30]). Barriers to scale up elsewhere vary significantly according to the sub -
model considered (user -oriented vs result -oriented for example) and the sector it 
is applied in. Generally speaking, one major barrier, particularly in a B2C context, 
seems to have been consumers’ desire for the convenience and other intangible 
benefits that come with product ownership. Another issue concerns the underlying 
business case for the adoption of PSS; it often seems to be far from clear.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,55

Notes
 
1  Limits on the availability of scrap feedstock will be partially eased in the me dium term as 
an increasingly large anthropogenic metal stock is decommissioned and replaced.  
2  See page 57 of Parker et al. (2015[17]). 
3  These assessments generally highlight the retention of product cores, and the associated 
avoided material input costs, as a key cost advantage relative to traditional manufacturing.  
4  Airbnb turned its first profit in 2016, and was recently valued at around USD 30 billion 
(CNBC, 2017). 
5  Airbnb actually had around 3 million listings in November 2016. However, many of them 
– unavailable, shared, and private rooms for example – are not obviously comparable to a 
traditional hotel booking. STR therefore excludes these from their analysis.  
6  Individual product ow nership in the case of durable goods, and traditional service 
providers (e.g., hotels) in the case of services. 
7  There may also be a feedback mechanism from the growth of sharing platforms to the 
overall availability of spare capacity. For example, there  is some anecdotal evidence that the 
emergence of Airbnb has led to investments in the housing stock that may not have taken place 
otherwise. 
8  One issue relates to the feasibility of car sharing schemes in low density areas. The 
business case is probably greatly diminished in rural areas where a larger number of stations would 
be required to serve a given population. This barrier is probably minor given the high proportion of 
people living in urban areas.  
9  To be sure, some of this differential probably also reflects differing performance levels. 
10  For example, the adoption of product service system model – and the retention of product 
ownership that goes with it – may well serve to incentivise the parallel adoption of the product life 
extension model. 
11  Path dependency may also be relevant for the resource recovery business model. 
Secondary material markets are characterised by high levels of price volatility, and this probably 
makes investment in secondary processing facilities less attractive. Addres sing the barriers that 
hinder secondary material markets will boost output and thereby lead to more liquid markets with 
less price volatility. 
12  Consider the role that waste management policies and new technologies have played in 
stimulating (respectively) higher recycling rates and the sharing of underutilised consumer assets.

Chapter 4.  The environmental impacts of circular business models 
This chapter focuses on the environmental potential of circular business models. Drawing 
primarily on insights from the lifecycle assessment (LCA) literature, it assesses  and 
compares the environmental footprint of goods and services produced via circular modes 
of production to those produced via more traditional means. Thus, recycled materials are 
compared to those made from virgin natural resources, remanufactured products are 
compared to new products, and the sharing or leasing of assets is compared to 
conventional ownership. While the environmental potential of circular business models is 
found to be broadly positive, the analysis also identifies several risks and unintended 
consequences that could result from their more widespread adoption.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,62

BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
4.1. Introduction 
One reason for the recent interest in promoting a circular economy transition is the 
reduction in environmental impacts that could result. Circular business models, by closing 
resource loops and by slowing and narrowing resource flows, will, in theory, reduce the 
environmental footprint of production and consumption activities. That said, what is the 
evidence that these business models actually serve to displace resource extractio n, 
processing, and disposal? And how does this translate into improved environmental 
outcomes? Which business models hold the greatest promise in this respect? These are 
the questions that this chapter attempts to address. 
Establishing the environmental im pacts associated with the emergence of circular 
business models is complex task for various reasons:  
There are five business models considered in this paper, all of which have distinct sub -
types. Each individual business model, or business model sub-type, operates in more than 
one economic sector. For example, sharing models are best known in the short term 
lodging and transport sectors, but are also relevant across a wider range of consumer 
products.1 This diversity makes it difficult to generalize about the likely environmental 
impacts. 
The emergence of a particular business model in a specific economic sector will have 
implications across a range of environmental impact categories including, but not limited 
to, global warming, particulate air pollution, acidification, eutrophication, toxicity, and 
solid waste generation potential.  
Changes in each environmental impact category can emerge at different points in the 
product lifecycle. For example, remanufacturing heavy machinery probably reduces the 
greenhouse gas emissions associated with upstream material extraction, transport, and 
processing but, to the extent that it results in an energy efficiency differential between 
new and remanufactured products, it can also affect the emissions during the machinery’s 
in-use phase.  
The environmental impacts of a particular business model probably change as that 
business model emerges. For example, it is likely that the greenhouse gas mitigation 
potential associated with recycling will decrease at high recycling rates.  
The emergence of a particular business model in a specific sector will lead to changes in 
relative prices and an array of indirect economic effects. The resulting changes in activity 
levels in other sectors will also have an environmental impact. 
The intention in this chapter is to be as comprehensive as possible, however the above 
complexity serves to limit what can be feasibly covered. 
The environmental impact associated with the emergence of a circular business model 
depends on both the market share that it captures (and the feedbacks this has on output 
from traditional modes of production, and on the wider economy) and on the relative 
environmental footprint of the circular and traditional modes of production. This chapter 
sets out to address both is sues. Section 4.2 describes insights from intuitive approaches 
such as the circularity ladder concept. Section 4.3 draws on the life cycle analysis (LCA) 
literature to provide insights into the environmental footprint of different business 
models. The main weakness of these studies is their engineering approach; little attention 
is given to economic mechanisms and to the extent that circular modes of production will 
actually displace other activities. Section 4.4 therefore addresses economic effects, and",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,63
"4. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS │ 63 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
particularly how the emergence of a particular circular business model might alter the 
structure of the broader economy. 
4.2. Insights from the circularity ladder concept 
The environmental desirability of different solid waste management options is embedded 
in th e concept of a waste hierarchy (Box 4.1). In this framework, waste prevention is 
considered to be preferable to waste disposal because the environmental pressures 
associated with the mobilisation and disposal of materials are avoided. Different circular 
business models have different implications for the volume and ultimate destination of 
industrial and municipal solid wastes. Some business models – those relating to product 
life extension for example – probably serve to reduce the amount of waste generated . 
Others – resource recovery business models for example – are unlikely to influence waste 
generation, but will divert the waste that is generated away from disposal activities. 
Mapping the incidence of each circular business model to the waste hierarchy m ay 
therefore provide some insight into their relative environmental impacts. 
 
Box 4.1. The waste hierarchy 
The waste hierarchy is a concept that guides waste management policy in many OECD 
and non-OECD countries. Although the goal or objective of the waste hierarchy is rarely 
made explicit, it is often interpreted to be the minimization of the environmental impacts 
associated with the various solid waste management options (e.g. SEI, 2005 ([1])). Various 
versions of the hierarchy exist; the version embedded in the EU Waste Framework 
Directive (EU Directive 2008/98/EC) is perhaps the most cited. It ranks solid waste 
management options from most to least preferable as follows: (i) prevention, (ii) 
preparing for re -use, (iii) recycling, (iv) other recovery (e.g., energy), (v) disposal. In 
other words, from an environmental perspective, the priority should be to first limit the 
generation of waste, then to r ecycle and recover what is generated, and only then to 
dispose of what remains. This hierarchy is broadly consistent with the idea that the main 
objective of the circular economy is to maintain the value of products, components, and 
materials at their highest level. 
 
 
This approach to assessing the relative environmental desirability of different circular 
business models has been undertaken by De Groene and Ethica (2015[2]), who term the 
resulting output the “circularity ladder” ( Figure 4.1). Based  on their work, product life 
extension and sharing models appear to be env ironmentally preferable to resource 
recovery business models. Product life extension and sharing business models, by 
slowing resource loops and narrowing resource flows respectively, have the potential to 
reduce the amount of waste generated. In contrast, the influence of resource recovery 
business models tends to be limited to diverting already existing waste towards material 
and energy recovery facilities. Product services can have an influence throughout the 
entire waste hierarchy. Product -oriented PSS v ariants, by including after sales service in 
the sales proposition, extend the life of products and prevent waste generation. Result -
oriented PSS variants can have a similar impact since service providers have a greater",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,64
"64 │ 4. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS

incentive to use material inputs spa ringly. Both result -oriented and user -oriented PSS 
variants, where product ownership is retained by the manufacturer, can create better 
incentives for recycling.   
The circularity ladder approach provides a useful “first -pass” assessment of the relative 
environmental desirability of different circular business models. There are two main 
issues to be aware of. First, the waste hierarchy ranks waste management options 
according to the environmental impacts associated with the end of life phase of the 
product lifecycle; it is unclear whether the ranking remains valid when the entire product 
life-cycle is taken into account. For example, if the in-use environmental impacts of long-
lived, energy intensive consumer products are considered, it may not always be the  case 
that product repair is preferable to recycling, especially when new products have 
significant improve energy or water efficiency. Second, the circularity ladder provides 
little insight into the likely magnitude of the environmental benefits associate d with 
different business models. Questions regarding the size of the potential greenhouse gas 
savings associated with remanufacturing activities, or the reduction in acidification 
potential associated with metal recycling, are better addressed by LCAs.

the resource recovery, product life extension, and product service system business 
models, and the selection presented here should not be considered to be exhaustive. The 
circular supply and sharing business models have received relatively little attention in the 
LCA literature. In this section, the likely environmental footprint of circular supply 
models is therefore discussed alongside those for the resource recovery business model. 
The rationale for this is that these two business models, from an environmental 
perspective, can be seen as two sides to the same coin. The former involves product 
manufacturers switching to bio-based and/or recovered inputs while the latter involves the 
provision of some of these inputs. Fin ally, the discussion of the environmental footprint 
of sharing models, in the absence of LCA data, is more general and based on the 
underlying characteristics of that business model.  
 
 
Box 4.2. Life cycle analysis: a brief summary 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an internationally standardized methodology for 
establishing the environmental footprint of a particular product (good or service). Within 
the requirements of ISO 14040 and 14044, an LCA must compris e the following steps 
(WRAP, 2010[3]): 
Goal and scope definition which defines the goal and intended use of the LCA, and 
scopes the assessment concerning system boundaries, function and flow, required  data 
quality, technology and assessment parameters, 
Inventory analysis (LCI) which consists in collecting data on inputs (resources and 
intermediate products) and outputs (emissions, wastes) for all the processes in the product 
system.  
Impact assessment (LCIA), phase during which inventory data on inputs and outputs are 
translated into indicators of potential impacts on the environment, on human health, and 
on the availability of natural resources. 
Interpretation of results where the results of the LCI an d LCIA are interpreted according 
to the goal of the study and where sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are performed to 
qualify the results and the conclusions. 
A LCA can either be undertaken for a product in isolation, or for one product relative to 
another. This distinction is important in the context of this chapter, which seeks to 
establish the environmental footprint of circular modes of production, either relative to 
other circular modes (recycling vs remanufacturing), or relative to more traditional modes 
(recycling vs primary material production). Because their underlying scope and 
assumptions often differ, it is generally difficult to compare the results from different 
LCA studies. As such, the data presented here are taken mostly from individual studies 
that effectively compare two LCAs: one for the footprint of the “circular” product, and 
one for the footprint of the “traditional” product. This is the origin of indicators like 
avoided resource extraction, energy use, and waste disposal.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,66

BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
Relative to the circularity ladder approach, 2 the key strengths of LCA are its transparent 
methodology and its capacity to provide quantitative results. It is possible to assess the 
potential magnitude of the change in environmental footprint as well as it s general 
direction. With respect to the mainly “comparative” LCAs considered in this chapter, the 
main weakness relates to assumptions about the nature of the counterfactual. For 
example, it is often assumed, when calculating the environmental impact of r ecycling, 
that the resulting unit of secondary output displaces one unit of primary output further 
upstream.3 This allows estimates of avoided material and energy extraction to be made, 
and these can then be converted into changes in global warming, acidif ication, 
eutrophication, and toxicity potential. As discussed further in Section 4.4, the extent to 
which output associated with circular modes of production actually displaces that 
associated with traditional production is largely determined by economic m echanisms.4 
Assuming a one to one displacement of traditional output may be overly optimistic, 
especially when rebound and other indirect economic effects are accounted for.  
4.3.1. Circular supply and resource recovery business models 
General environmental considerations 
Relative to a scenario involving disposal, transforming waste into secondary materials 
and using them as new inputs is widely considered to have positive first order 
environmental effects. By diverting waste towards recovery facilities, reso urce recovery 
business models reduce the volume of material that requires landfilling or incineration, 
and therefore the environmental impacts of these activities. Similarly, by increasing the 
supply of secondary materials, resource recovery business models can reduce demand for 
primary resources, and the environmental impacts associated with their extraction. 
Further, producing finished materials from waste typically requires considerably less 
energy and, depending on the energy mix, greenhouse gas emissio ns than doing so from 
virgin resources. For example, secondary copper and aluminum production requires only 
around 35% and 5% of the energy used in the respective primary processes  (BIR, 
2008[4]). 
LCA data: the example of recycling 
There are a vast number of LCAs that assess the environmental footprint of recycling 
relative to other end of life solid waste management options. Various meta -analyses of 
this body of work have been undertaken and, in some ca ses, comprise as many as several 
hundred individual studies (Table 4.1). Some meta-analyses focus on a particular material; 
plastics (HPRC, 2015 [5]; Bernardo, Simões and Pinto, 2016 [6]), paper and cardboard 
(EEA, 2006 [7]; NCASI, 2012 [8]), and organic waste (Morris, Matthews and Morawski, 
2012[9]) are all common. Others focus on either a variety of materials  (WRAP, 2010[10]; 
Valerio, 2010 [11]; DSEWPC, 2012 [12]; Laurent et  al., 2014 [13]), or on a composite waste 
product like municipal solid waste (Cleary, 2009 [14]). In terms of the environmental 
impact categories considered, most individual studies assess the effect of recycling on 
resource consumption, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions. Some studies also 
assess the impacts on acidification and eutrophication potential, eco-toxicity, and avoided 
solid waste disposal. Less than 20% of LCAs on solid waste management assess impacts 
on land and water use (Laurent et al., 2014[13]).",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,67

The assumptions underlying individual LCAs vary considerably; a useful summary is 
provided by Laurent et al. (2014[13]). One key issue relates to the multi -functional 
character of material and energy recovery processes. For example, the environmental 
impacts of recycling result from both its waste management function (avoided dispo sal) 
as well as its role in the production of secondary commodities (avoided virgin resource 
extraction and processing). Assumptions about the volume (how much waste is recovered 
as opposed to disposed of?) and type (how substitutable are the recovered sec ondary 
materials for their primary equivalents?) of avoided resource extraction will significantly 
influence results. According to Laurent et al. (2014[13]), “most reviewed studies assume a 
substitution ratio of 1:1 and/or a quality similar to the substituted product”. By ignoring 
the existence of down -cycling, this approach can lead to overestimates of the 
environmental benefits resulting from material recovery. 5 Other key issues that are 
highlighted include the treatment of capital goods (are the environmental impacts 
associated with the construction of material recovery infrastructure accounted for?), and 
collection and transport (are the environmental impacts associated with these activiti es 
accounted for?). 
The key high level conclusion that emerges from the meta -analyses presented in Table 4.1 
is that recycling has a small environment al footprint relative to traditional disposal  
activities.6 WRAP (2006[15]) assessed 55 “state of the art” LCAs of paper and cardboard, 
glass, plastics, aluminium, steel, wood, and aggregates, and  conclude that “most studies 
show that recycling offers more environmental benefits and lower environmental impacts 
than the other waste management options”. On the basis of 222 individual studies, 
Laurent et al. (2014[13]) state that “ … for waste paper, all studies favour recycling or 
thermal treatment over landfilling” and “ … a relatively large proportion of studies tend 
to favour recycling over landfilling and thermal processes for plastics and  paper”. 
Bernardo, Simoes and Pinto (2016[6]) focussed on LCAs of plastics and found that “the 
results reported are generally consistent, showing that recycling has the lowest 
environmental impact on Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Total Energy Use (TEU) 
impacts”.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,68
"68 │ 4. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
Several of the meta -analyses present caveats to the conclusion that the environmental 
footprint of recycling is smaller than that for traditional disposal. Some caveats relate to 
specific materials. WRAP (2010[10]) state that, “for wood and textiles, more studies are 
needed to be able to make firmer conclusions regarding the environmental benefits of 
recycling”. Other caveats rel ate to data limitations. NCASI (2012[8]) state that, “while 
many of the reviewed studies resulted in findings that suggest a lower LCA profile for 
recovery for recycling over landfilling as an end-of-life option for paper, the applicability 
of this finding is limited, given the extent to which it depends on assumptions regarding 
paper degradation in landfills and the methods used to account for biogenic carbon, and 
the relative weakness of current LCA toxicity-related impact assessment”.  
It is also apparent from the existing literature that the environmental impacts of recycling 
vary significantly across materials. Figure 4.2 shows data from a LCA undertaken in New 
South Wales, Australia by the Department of Environment, Climate Change, and Water 
(NSW EPA, 2010 [17]). Recycling of metals is sho wn to have considerably larger 
environmental benefits in terms of avoided greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and 
water use than recycling of building materials, paper and cardboard, organics, glass, or 
plastics. This is probably a function of the extrem ely high energy and water intensity of 
crushing, beneficiating, and refining mineral ores into finished metal products.  
Figure 4.2. Average net environmental benefits of recycling 1 tonne of waste in Australia 
 
Source: NSW EPA (2010[17]), Environmental benefits of recycling, https://bit.ly/2xihXl2 
Finally, the environmental impacts of recycling are also li kely to vary significantly with 
recycling rates. This issue is raised by Ekvall (2007[18]), who state that “the environmental 
burdens of collection and recycling are likely to be a non -linear function of the collection 
GHG emissions (tonnes CO2 eq)Water use (kL)
Cumulative energy demand (GH LHV)
Solid waste (tonnes)",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,69

rate”, and, “at very high recycling rates, the required extra transport and processing of 
materials may increase fuel consumption and emissions greatly for each additional tonne 
of material that is collected”. In more concrete terms, i t is easy to imagine that the 
environmental benefits of collecting recyclable materials from smaller rural communities 
and transporting them to distant processing centres could require more energy use than it 
saves. This, in tandem with the private costs a nd benefits of recycling, raises the 
possibility of an optimum recycling rate. For example, cost benefit analysis undertaken 
for Japan finds that the recycling rate that minimises the average social cost7 of municipal 
solid waste management is around 10%, which is significantly less than current recycling 
rates of 20% (Kinnaman, Shinkuma and Yamamoto, 2014 [19]). Optimum recycling rates 
are likely to evolve over time as new technologies emerge and market prices change. 
 
4.3.2. Product life extension models 
General environmental considerations 
Product life extension business models, whether classic long life, direct reuse, 
maintenance and repair, or refurbishment and remanufacturing, tend to slow the flow of 
products and materials through the economy. This is widely considered to be positive 
from an environmental viewpoint. Reduced demand for new products translates up the 
value chain into reduced extraction and processing of new resources, and down the value 
chain into reduced disposal. The associated environmental impact of these activities is 
thereby reduced.  
There are at least three second order factors that may, at least partially, offset such 
environmental gains.8 First, the average environmental footprint of in -use products may 
increase if longer lived products slow the diffusion of new, r elatively efficient designs. 
This is of particular concern for product categories characterized by large use phase 
impacts and rapid technological progress. 9 Second, with the exception of the classic long 
life business model, product life extension process es also require inputs of materials and 
energy. For example, the environmental footprint of transporting a product to a repair or 
remanufacturing facility may be non-negligible. Third, if choosing repaired, second-hand, 
or remanufactured goods creates sign ificant consumer savings, then there will also be 
potential for rebound effects. Essentially, the additional consumption resulting from 
increased disposable income also has an environmental footprint.  
These three concerns apply to different extents for ea ch of the four product life extension 
sub-models. For example, because higher prices are central to the classic long life 
business model, there is little potential for direct rebound effects. Further, because this 
business model (when considered in isolati on) dispels with the need for post -sales repair 
or remanufacture, it also negates the environmental footprint of these activities (transport 
for example). As such, the classic long life business model has considerable potential 
from an environmental perspe ctive, especially for product categories (such as clothing) 
where a low proportion of the lifecycle environmental footprint is associated with the use-
phase (see DEFRA (2011[20]) for further discuss ion). More generally, it is unclear from 
the existing literature to what extent the environmental benefits associated with longer 
lived products (reduced extraction and processing of new resources, reduced disposal of 
end of life products) are offset by second order effects.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,70

LCA data: the example of remanufacturing 
There are a considerable number of LCAs that assess the environmental footprint of 
product remanufacturing, typically relative to a scenario involving product disposal and 
the purchase of an equ ivalent new product. The product focus in these studies is diverse, 
but common categories include automobiles (and their constituent parts), imaging 
equipment, and printer cartridges. A selection of this literature is presented in Table 4.2. 
Most studies focus on a limited subset of impact categories. Avoided energy use and 
greenhouse gas emissions are the most common, and avoided resource extraction an d 
waste disposal are also occasionally assessed.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,71

The key conclusion that emerges from the LCA literature is that remanufacturing can 
result in sectoral reductions in resource extraction and waste disposal that are often in the 
order of 80%. This, in turn, will translate into a variety of environmental impacts. The 
one that is most frequently evaluated in the literature is the avoided greenhouse gas 
emissions associated with extr action and processing of virgin resources into new 
products. Although the sectoral reductions in resource extraction, energy consumption,",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,72
"72 │ 4. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
and greenhouse gas emissions shown in Table 4.2 seem large, they are consistent with the 
nature of remanufacturing. In many cases, it is the deterioration of a small number of 
parts or components, rather than a failure of the product itself, that leads to a loss of 
functionality. Remanufacturing worn out parts, while retaining the core of the original 
product, can therefore prevent the loss of a high proportion of the constituent materials, 
along with their embedded energy content. 
As discussed in the introduction to th is section, there are at least three second order 
effects that may partially offset the upstream environmental benefits associated with 
longer lived products. Two of these – the environmental footprint of transporting used 
cores, and the potential for rebound effects resulting from consumer savings – are largely 
ignored in the remanufacturing LCAs considered here. Further, most of the LCAs in 
Table 4.2 appear to assume zero recycling rates in their “disposal and buy a new product 
scenario” when, in reality, significant proportions of some end of life products are 
recycled (the chassis’ of end of life vehicles for example). 
Gutowski et al. (2011[26]) is the only study considered here that accounts for the impact of 
remanufacturing on the diffusion of new product designs.10 One important conclusion that 
emerges from this work is that, for certain product categories, the relatively poor energy 
efficiency of retained (remanufactured) products can more than offset the energy savings 
associated with reduced material production a nd traditional manufacturing (e.g. 
Figure 4.3: products 20 to 25 – dishwashers, monitor screens, refrigerators, and some 
computers). The authors highli ght that this risk is greatest for long -lived product 
categories characterised by high use -phase energy requirements and rapid efficiency 
improvements.

cartridge (10), engines (11, 12), electric engines (13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19), tires (9, 22, 16). 
In sum, remanufacturing, like other product life extension business models, leads to 
avoided resource extraction, processing, and disposal; the environmental damages 
resulting from these associated with these activities will therefore be reduced. What is 
less clear from this review is the extent to which these environmental benefits are offset

by various second order effects, especially those associated with the use phase of the 
product life cycle. 11 Because remanufacturing keeps existing products in circulation for 
longer, it may also slow the diffusion of new and relatively efficient product designs. 
Caution in promoting manufacturing is warranted when the affected product categories 
are characterized by: (i) long product lives, (ii) energy or water intensive during the use 
phase, and (iii) high rates of efficiency improvements.  
4.3.3. Sharing models 
General environmental considerations 
Sharing models are based upon short term rental transactions of under -utilised economic 
assets or goods. They provide consumers with additional choice: instead of buying goods 
from a traditional business provider, it is possible to temporarily lease them from an 
individual. In terms of the environmental implications of this shift, there is a widely held 
view that, by facilitating the use of under -utilised goods, sharing models will have 
positive environmental impacts. Many platforms advertise themselves as green, and 
particularly as carbon -footprint reducing (e.g., Frenken an d Schor, 2017  ([33])). 
Consumers often appear to share this opinion. A survey undertaken by PWC in 2016 
found that 76% of surveyed individuals believed that “the sharing economy is better for 
the environment” (PWC, 2015[34]). Further, a survey undertaken by Bocker and Meelen 
(2017[35]) found that this perceived greenness was a key moti vation for participating in 
certain sectors of the sharing economy.12 
The idea underlying these attitudes seems to be that lower demand for new goods can 
reduce virgin resource extraction, material processing, and manufacturing, and therefore 
the environmen tal impacts associated with these activities. While there is likely to be 
some substance to this idea, the academic literature on these effects is more equivocal. 
There is little empirical evidence that sharing business models are, by definition, positive 
from an environmental viewpoint. Box 4.3 provides key conclusions from a set of recent 
assessments. 
 
Box 4.3. Environmental impacts of sharing models: evidence from recent assessments 
IDDRI (2014[36]): “the environmental impact of these (sharing) practices, in the way that 
they have developed today, is rarely obvious and there are many reasons to raise doubts: a 
degree of pragmatism is required” … and … “In particular, the analysis of the 
sustainability of the (sharing) models is hampered by the lack of studies and its 
dissemination. To quote the candid remarks of one expert, “it is hard to reason on the 
basis of very poor statistical data.” 
The Economist (2015): “In many cases, the benefits of sharing economy services are that 
they reduce cost and improve convenience —both of which might, in fact, boost 
consumption”. 
European Commission (2016[37]): “Available empirical evidence to date is very partial 
and inconclusive - in many cases, it is simply anecdotal and often presented by 
stakeholders in the current controversies. For example, Uber and Airbnb have released 
dozens of reports, the reliability of which could not be independently validated because 
the methodologies are not transparently illustrated and data are kept internal and not made",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,74

BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
 
Although robust data are unavailable, the environmental impacts associated with the 
continued emergence of sharing models will depend largely on at least three factors: (i) 
the effect that increased utilisation rates have on goods’ expected lifetimes, (ii) the 
composition of the additional consumption resulting from any financial savings, 13 and 
(iii) the existence of any differences in the life -cycle environmental footprin t of shared 
and traditional goods (e.g., IDDRI, 2014  ([36])). Given the previously mentioned lack of 
empirical data, the remainder of this section focusses on discussing each of these factors. 
The effect that increased utilisation of spare capacity will have on demand for new goods, 
and therefore on demand for virgin resource inputs, will depend on how increased 
utilisation affects the expected lifetime of the relevant goods. If the expected life  of a 
good is strongly related to how frequently it is used, then any increase in utilisation rates 
will lead to shorter product lives, more rapid product turnover, and a limited impact on 
overall demand.14 This scenario is probably most relevant for produc ts like vehicles or 
personal computers. In contrast, if the expected life of a good is not strongly related to 
how frequently it is used (consider housing or household tools for example), then 
increased utilisation may well lead to reduced demand for new production. 
Consumer surveys suggest that a key motivation for participating in the peer to peer 
markets is the availability of considerable savings (Böcker and Meelen, 2017 [35]). In 
concrete terms, it is considerably cheaper for consumers to satisfy demand for goods, 
mobility, and short stay accommodation through leasing rather than buying. The resulting 
financial savings can result in a rebound effect, where the environmental fo otprint of new 
consumption at least partially offsets any environmental benefits resulting from sharing. 
Relatedly, there is some (mostly anecdotal) evidence that the earning opportunities made 
possible by the emergence of sharing models are actually stimu lating investment in new 
capacity in certain markets. For example, it seems likely that some of the vehicles used by 
Uberpool drivers, and some of the apartments leased by Airbnb hosts, would never have 
been purchased in the absence of those platforms. Kee ping these considerations in mind 
accessible to researchers”. 
Sierra Club (2017[38]): “Many well -meaning, environment -friendly people have bought 
the line that the sharing economy is green” and “When it comes to the “greenness” of the 
sharing economy, magical thinking and corporate press releases have replaced fact -based 
discourse”. 
ADEME (2016[39]): “Collaborative consumption does not necessarily signify responsible 
consumption. Indeed, the environmental gain depends strongly on the traditional activity 
that the collaborative activity replaces.” 
Trinomics (2017[40]): “To date, little objective and thorough research has been done on 
the true environmental impacts of the collaborative economy. Many studies only use 
anecdotal evidence or only took into account direct and indirect environmental impacts, 
but not the rebound effect, that is the effect of increased consumption because of a 
decrease in prices, extra money earned and saved through engaging in the collaborative 
economy instead of the traditional economy”. 
Nordic Council of Ministers (2017[41]): “More efficient use of the resources through 
sharing initiatives could also contribute to environmental benefits, but this depends on

is important when considering the overall environmental impact of sharing models 
(especially the avoided resource extraction and processing associated with the 
displacement of traditional providers). 
If shared goods and th eir traditionally marketed equivalents were identical , then the two 
factors discussed above would probably determine much of the environmental impact of 
sharing models. However, in reality, the goods involved are often not identical, and this 
means that they can have differing environmental footprints. This effect can work in both 
directions. For example, in the context of mobility, the shared vehicles that are listed on 
peer to peer platforms like Getaround are likely to have a higher emissions signature t han 
the vehicles leased by traditional car rental agencies. In contrast, in the context of short 
term lodging, it is often argued that the rooms listed on platforms like Airbnb have a 
smaller energy and water footprint than those in traditional hotels (see below).  
LCA and survey data: the example of sharing under-utilised accommodation 
As noted above, there is little systematic research that has assessed the environmental 
impacts of sharing models. What does exist often focusses on these business models in  
the short term lodging segment of the hospitality sector. This section presents three such 
assessments. Some of this work has been commissioned by the platform operators 
themselves; the results should be interpreted with that in mind.  
A 2016 study undert aken by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT) assesses the material savings that might be associated with 
the emergence of accommodation sharing (WEF, 2016[42]). Researchers were interested in 
the role that Airbnb played in Rio de Janeiro before, during, and after the 2014 Football 
World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games. The authors found that short -term Airbnb leases 
housed around 17% of the estimated 500 000 tour ists who visited Rio de Janeiro during 
the Olympic Games. This was calculated to represent the equivalent of 257 newly built 
hotels, each of which “would have been a large undertaking in terms of financing and 
material use”. This study was a preliminary ef fort, but does serve to highlight two of the 
shortcomings that are common to other assessments of sharing models. First, by 
overlooking economic mechanisms, it probably overestimates the impact that Airbnb had 
on hotel construction and, by extension, on re source extraction and use. 15 Second, this 
estimate of avoided resource extraction and use is not extended to more tangible 
environmental impact categories such as global warming, acidification, and toxicity 
potential. Not all resource extraction is necessar ily “bad”; the impacts involved will vary 
significantly according to the types of materials involved and where they are extracted 
and processed. 
A 2014 study commissioned by AirBnb focusses more on the comparative use phase 
environmental impacts of shared and traditional (hotel) short term accommodation 
(Cleantech, 2014[43]). The research was based on 8 000 survey respondents in Europe and 
North America; jurisdictions which currently make up the vast ma jority of Airbnb stays. 
The study found that Airbnb guests in these two geographic areas use 63 - 84% less 
energy and 12 – 57% less water per guest night than typical hotel guests.16 Based on 92% 
of the respondents reporting that they produced an equal or l ower amount of waste than 
when at home, it was also concluded that Airbnb stays produce 28 -53% less waste than 
hotel stays. On the basis of these reductions, it was calculated that Airbnb stays in Europe 
resulted in annual greenhouse gas savings equivalent  to removing 200 000 cars from the 
road and annual water use savings equivalent to 1 100 Olympic size swimming pools.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,76

A 2017 study undertaken by the Agence de l’Environnement et de la Matrise de l’Energie 
(ADEME) also assesses short term sharing relative to traditional hotel rooms (ADEME, 
2016[39]). The authors find that the differential environmental impacts of this choice are 
difficult to evaluate because of the number of factors that require conside ration. The 
importance of individual behaviour, the relative sizes of rooms and apartments associated 
with Airbnb and hotel stays, and the electricity mix in different host countries are all 
factors that need to be considered. One firm conclusion provided by ADEME is that the 
sharing of under-utlilised capacity in the short term lodging segment is most likely to be 
environmentally beneficial when it involves individual rooms rather than entire 
apartments. In this situation, the energy and water use required  for lighting, heating, and 
cleaning will be shared across more than one individual. 
4.3.4. Product-service systems 
General considerations 
Product service systems change patterns of asset ownership. Instead of purchasing a good 
or asset, consumers purchase the se rvice(s) that the good or service provides: actual 
ownership often remains with the original manufacturer. This characteristic of PSS 
creates a new set of incentives around product design, product use, and product disposal, 
with associated implications for the life-cycle environmental footprint of affected goods. 
From a manufacturer’s perspective, the adoption of the user -oriented or result -oriented 
PSS variants means assuming responsibility for product disposal at the end of life. In a 
similar way to exten ded producer responsibility schemes, this can create an incentive to 
design products that are amenable to life extension processes such as remanufacture, 
refurbishment, or repair. This incentive, which is likely to be positive from an 
environmental viewpoint, may be at least partially offset by three opposing effects. 
It has been suggested that concerns about cannibalizing rentals of relatively new product 
lines can lead PSS providers to prematurely remove old products from the market. 
Agrawal et al. (2012[44]) argue that such behavior could contribute to shorter product lives 
relative to a situation where individuals seek to sell, rather than dispose of assets (e.g. 
cars in the second hand car market).  
It is possible that consumers use leased goods less carefully than goods that they own 
(Kuo, 2011[45]) which, if true, would also contribute to shorter product lives.  
As discussed in Section 3.3, the environmental implications of longer lived products are 
not entirely clear; the upstream environmental benefits resulting from any reduction in 
demand for virgin resources may be partially offset by an increased environmental 
footprint in the use phase. 
The adoption of PSS also creates other environmentally favourable incentives. For 
manufacturers producing consumable goods like energy and chemicals, the adoption of 
the result-oriented PSS variant will create incentives for their more efficient use. Thi s is 
nicely explained by (Tukker, 2015 [46]), who states that “in result -oriented business 
models, the use of materials also becomes merely a cost factor – using more materials or 
creating more products  does not lead to increased revenues”. In addition, from a 
consumer perspective, the pay for use tariff structure of the user -oriented PSS variant 
may create incentives for more efficient product use. Because the variable cost of product 
use is more promin ent than when products are owned, there will be a tendency to use 
them relatively sparingly.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,77
"4. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS │ 77 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
User-oriented PSS business models are also being increasingly adopted in the context of 
digital products: e -books, streamed music and film, and digital media. Thi s has 
potentially significant environmental impacts because the material basis for these 
products becomes unnecessary. A subscription to Spotify or an online media outlet 
provides access to music and news without the need for CDs or newspapers. The key 
question in this context is the extent to which the associated reductions in resource 
extraction, processing, and eventual product disposal are offset by the increased resource 
mobilisation required for the development of digital infrastructure (data servers and cable 
networks) and personal electronic devices. Establishing the net environmental impact is 
challenging because of the different materials involved. 
Despite the existence of a considerable body of work on the environmental implications 
of PSS, there is little empirical evidence that they result in tangibly lower environmental 
pressure. The most comprehensive meta-analysis to date (Tukker, 2015[46]) concludes that 
“PSS will not by definition be more resource-efficient or ‘circular’ than product systems” 
but that “result -oriented PSS offers the greatest prospect of radical resource efficiency 
gains”. Currently operating examples of result -oriented – chemical leasing (e.g., OECD, 
2017 ([47])) or lighting or heating service contracts – are therefore worthy of additional 
attention. It is also likely that the environmental implications of the emergence of PSS 
will depend on the product category  affected. Agrawal et al. (2012[44]) and Intlekofer, 
Bras and Ferguson (2010[48]) find that environmental benefits are more likely to emerge  
when the product category involved is characterized by high use phase impacts and rapid 
technological progress. The following example therefore focusses on PSS as applied to 
urban car sharing. 
LCA and survey data: the example of urban car sharing schemes 
There is a considerable body of work that assesses the environmental impacts of car 
sharing. A selection of this literature is presented in Table 4.3. Most studies focus on the 
environmental impacts related to vehicle ownership and use. Vehicle kilometers travelled 
(VKT) and the associated greenhouse gas emissions, along with the number of  privately 
owned cars replaced by each shared vehicle are the most common impact categories. 
Changes in vehicle kilometers travelled are often viewed as a proxy for energy extraction 
and use, or for particulate emissions in urban environments. The number o f privately 
owned cars replaced is viewed as having implications for urban land use patterns, 
congestion, and virgin resource extraction rates (see below). Few studies consider the 
potential rebound effect associated with savings resulting from car sharing . This new 
consumption will tend to offset any gains associated with shared mobility.  
Most studies assessing the environmental impacts of car sharing use consumer surveys to 
establish how the existence of a car sharing scheme changes vehicle ownership and  
mobility decisions. Car sharing members are asked a variety of questions about how their 
driving behavior, vehicle ownership, and use of other transport modes change due to the 
introduction of a car sharing scheme. Typically, respondents are presented wit h a before 
and after scenario; they are asked to compare their current behavior with a counterfactual 
based on recollections of their past behavior. 17 It is important to keep in mind the 
shortcomings of such an approach. First, individuals’ recollections of  their past behavior 
may deviate from their actual behavior; any systematic deviation will tend to bias the 
results of the subsequent analysis. Second, the current behavior of surveyed individuals is 
unlikely to be entirely attributable to the introduction  of a vehicle sharing scheme. For 
example, changes in fuel prices are also likely to affect transport decisions.18",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,78

The vehicles available through car sharing schemes are not necessarily representative of 
the wider vehicle fleet. They are often smaller and a re increasingly electric, and may 
therefore have lower environmental impacts relative to an “average” private vehicle. 
Some studies incorporate this effect via life cycle analysis. This approach is typically of 
limited scope, focusing mostly on the differe ntial energy use and greenhouse gas 
emissions associated with the use phase of the vehicle life. Any differential 
environmental impacts associated with vehicle manufacturing and disposal are largely 
ignored (although see Doka and Ziegler, 2001 ([49])).

resulting from access to a car sharing scheme, and (iii) associated shifts in transport modes.

Results from individual studies shown in Table 4.3 are not directly comparable. The 
boundary of each analysis varies, as do assumptions about key parameters. For example, 
in estimating the impact of car sharing on transport related GHG emis sions, some studies 
restrict their analysis to the impact resulting purely from different car designs (e.g. Doka 
and Ziegler, 2001  ([49])), or purely from behavioral changes (e.g. Martin and Sh aheen, 
2011 ([56])). Further, the treatment of changes in transport modes resulting from the 
introduction of car sharing differs across studies. Some assessments account for 
emissions associated with shifts to other transport modes (e.g. Firnkorn and Muller, 2011  
([57])) whereas others ignore this effect on the basis that is likely to be small (e.g. Martin 
and Shaheen, 2011  ([56])). Finally, different types of car sharing are considered by 
different studies. Some assessments only consider one -way systems (e.g. Firnkorn and 
Muller, 2011 ([57])), others only consider roundtrip systems (e.g Millard -Ball et al. 2005 
([51])), and some (e.g. Nijland and van Meerkerk, 2017 ([61])) include both. 
The environmental impact associated with the introduction of a car sharing scheme is 
consistent across the studies shown in Table 4.3. On average, members drive fewer  
kilometers, emit fewer GHG, and own fewer cars than they did previously. This 
aggregate outcome masks important variations in individual level behaviour. For 
example, various studies indicate that the majority of active car sharing members do not 
own a pr ivate vehicle. Around 58% of respondents in Martin, Shaheen and Lidicker",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,79

(2011[55]) said that they joined car sharing because they didn’t have a car of their own. For 
this portion of the population,  gaining access to a car sharing scheme probably serves to 
increase VKT (and probably also GHG emissions) as individuals shift away from other 
transport modes. The fact that overall VKT and GHG emissions fall appears to be, in 
large part, due to the behavi or of a minority of car owning individuals. Survey data 
indicates that this portion of the population responds to the introduction of a car sharing 
scheme by reducing vehicle ownership and substituting shared mobility or other transport 
modes for private c ar ownership. Research by Martin and Shaheen (2011[56]) finds that 
the emissions reductions associated with this portion of the population more than offset 
the emissions increases associated with in dividuals without previous vehicle access 
(Figure 4.4). 
Figure 4.4. Changes in mobility related to GHG emissions due to the introduction of a car 
sharing scheme 
 
Note: Cumulative annual change in emissions represents the annual change in emissions made by each car 
sharing member multiplied by the number of individuals that make the same response.  
Source: Martin and Shaheen (2011[56]). 
The studies shown in Table 4.3 also indicate that having acc ess to a car sharing scheme 
can lead to reduced rates of car ownership. This has at least two potential impacts on the 
environmental pressures associated with mobility. First, a smaller vehicle stock reduces 
demand for parking space. This can have positive  environmental implications in urban 
areas where the sealing of bare ground can lower aquifer recharge rates and reduce 
resilience to storm events. Second, reduced vehicle demand may lead to lower rates or 
virgin resource extraction further upstream. This idea is controversial, it relies heavily on 
the assumption that demand reductions resulting from reduced private car ownership are 
not offset by any reduction in average vehicle life (i.e., due to high utilisation rates of 
shared vehicles). The net effect of car sharing on overall vehicle demand and resource 
extraction is uncertain without data on the average life of shared vehicles. 
4.4. How economic feedbacks influence environmental outcomes  
The LCA literature provides a valuable insight into the environmental footprint of 
circular products and modes of production relative to traditional equivalents. However, 
the actual environmental impact of circular business models will also depend on the 
output growth they can achieve, the extent to which this output displaces that associated 
with traditional production modes, and on the indirect effects that this has on the",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,80
"80 │ 4. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
composition of the broader economy  (Zink and Geyer, 2017 [62]). Furthermore, the 
emergence of global value chains means that these broader effects are unlikely to be 
restricted to a particular jurisdiction, but will influence economic and environmental 
outcomes across borders. In sum, focussing solely on LCA studies alone may result in an 
incomplete view of the environmental potential of circular business models.   
There is a growing literature of accounting studies that deal with this issue by combining 
results from LCA studies with assumptions about the market share that a circular business 
model could capture in the future. For example, TNO (2013[63]) find that increased 
recycling in the Dutch consumer electronics and food sec tors could lead to emissions 
reductions of 747 000 tonnes and 150 000 tonnes of CO 2 per year respectively. Similarly, 
the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (2013[64]) find that higher reuse and remanufactu ring 
rates for mobile phones in the EU could eradicate 1 300 000 tonnes of CO 2e annually. 
While these accounting approaches do give some indication of the overall environmental 
potential of a circular economy transition, they tend to ignore the economic realities that 
such a transition is conditional upon. In particular, it is often assumed that circular 
business models will scale up regardless of their underlying profitability, and that the new 
output will displace that associated with traditional produc tion modes on a one -to-one 
basis. These assumptions, along with the fact that indirect economic effects are largely 
ignored, mean that the likelihood of achieving the stated environmental benefits is 
probably small. 
Addressing the various market failures, policy misalignments, status quo biases, and other 
barriers (see Chapter 3) that hinder the profitability of circular business models will tend 
to stimulate future scale up. The environmental implications of this scale up will emerge 
through two main chann els. Direct environmental impacts will result from the expansion 
of the new business model in a particular sector. Indirect environmental impacts will 
result from changes in the activity levels of other sectors of the economy in response to 
general equilib rium price effects. Establishing the overall environmental impact 
associated with the emergence of a circular business model requires consideration of both 
(Figure 4.5).

4.4.1. Direct environmental impacts of circular business model scale up 
The selected LCA l iterature presented in this chapter indicates that the environmental 
footprint of circular products and circular modes of production is typically significantly 
smaller than for their traditional equivalents. By closing and slowing resource loops, and 
by na rrowing resource flows, these business models reduce the extraction, transport, 
processing, and disposal of new resources, and the environmental pressures associated 
with these activities. For example, the existing LCAs focusing on remanufacturing find 
that it can save 80 to 90% of the energy that is required to manufacture certain types of 
new products. The direct environmental effect associated with the emergence of a circular 
business model will depend both on this difference in footprints, as well as on  the extent 
to which traditional production is displaced. 
As discussed, most LCA and accounting assessments of the environmental impact of 
circular business models assume that output from an emerging circular business model 
will displace that from a traditional business model on a one-to-one basis. This may be an 
overly optimistic assumption from an economic viewpoint, especially if the respective 
products are not perfect substitutes. For example, in the context of metal recycling, it is 
well established that secondary metals are less substitutable for their primary equivalents 
in certain high performance applications (Koffler et al., 2013[65]). Similarly, for sharing 
models, it is unlikely that short term lodging á la Airbnb is a perfect substitute for hotel 
rooms; many business travelers continue to prefer the convenience of the latter. Limited 
substitutability may mean that some circular products will be produced in addition, rather 
than instead of, traditional products (Zink and Geyer, 2017[62]).19 If true, this implies that 
the overall direct environmental benefit of the growth of circular business models may be 
smaller than predicted.20  
4.4.2. Indirect environmental impacts of circular business model scale up 
The emergence of a circular business model in a particular sector cannot be considered in 
isolation. Increased activity will typically tri gger changes in relative prices, thereby 
leading to spill-over and feedback effects elsewhere in the economy (Hertwich, 2005[66]). 
In terms of their environmental impact, these general equilibrium eff ects can act to “take 
back” the first order environmental gains associated with a particular business model. 
Sorrell and Dimitripoulos (2008[67]) distinguish three types of indirect or general 
equilibrium economic effects: 
Direct rebound effects occur when lower product prices, perhaps resulting from the 
emergence of a more resource efficient technology, mode of production, or product, lead 
to additional consumption. This often involves consumers. For example, although the fuel 
efficiency of vehicle engines has improved markedly over recent decades, the average 
fuel consumption per kilometre travelled has barely changed; consumers have opted to 
use the savings to buy larger and heavier vehicles. Dire ct rebound effects also involve 
firms. For example, increased penetration of heavy machinery remanufacturing will tend 
to reduce upstream resource extraction, but the resulting fall in prices may trigger 
additional demand for these materials from other production sectors. 
Indirect effects occur when consumers allocate monetary savings, perhaps resulting from 
the emergence of a more resource efficient technology, mode of production, or product, 
to additional consumption of other goods and services (with an a ssociated material and 
environmental footprint). For example, consumers may decide to allocate additional",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,82
"82 │ 4. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
disposable income from sharing power tools (rather than buying them) to additional 
overseas travel. 
Economy wide effects occur when the emergence of a  more resource efficient 
technology, mode of production, or product triggers changes in the composition or size of 
the overall economy. For example, a number of modelling assessments indicate that 
resource efficiency and circular economy policies could gen erate significant economic 
growth (McCarthy, Dellink and Bibas, 2018 [68]). This additional output will clearly have 
an associated material and environmental footprint. 
The key message here is that gaining a better unde rstanding of the overall environmental 
impact of circular economy business models requires considering the full range of 
dynamic and indirect economic feedbacks. Research in other fields has highlighted the 
potential importance of these mechanisms. Empiric al assessments of the direct rebound 
effect in the context of energy efficiency improvements find that they are typically in the 
order of 15 to 30%, and occasionally as high as 50 to 60% (Hertwich, 2005 [66]). 
Modelling assessments have also been undertaken, and often suggest that the size of the 
total rebound effect can exceed 50% (Dimitropoulos, 2007 [69]; Koesler, Swales and 
Turner, 2016 [70]; Parrado, Eni and Mattei, 2017 [71]). The magnitude of these effects is 
quite striking given that they have been largely overlooked in assessments of the 
environmental impacts of circular business models. As stated in a recent review, 
“proponents of the circular economy have tended to look a t the world purely as an 
engineering system and have overlooked the economic part of the circular economy” 
(Zink and Geyer, 2017[62]). 
4.5. Conclusions 
This chapter has highlighted the complexity involved i n assessing the environmental 
impact of circular business models. Not only are there a wide range of business models 
involved, but there are also a variety of different approaches available to estimate their 
impacts. In addition, the impacts associated wit h each business model often emerge at 
different parts of the product lifecycle.21 Based on the material presented in this chapter, it 
is possible to draw four main conclusions. 
First, results from the LCA literature indicate that the environmental footprint  of the 
output from circular modes of production can be significantly smaller than that associated 
with traditional modes. As such, the emergence of circular business models, to the extent 
that this results in the displacement of traditional forms of produ ction, is likely to have a 
positive direct impact on environmental outcomes. By closing and slowing resource 
loops, and by narrowing resource flows, these business models will lead to less 
extraction, transport, processing, and disposal of virgin resources , and thereby reduce the 
environmental pressures associated with these activities.22  
Second, the LCA and accounting studies presented here do not account for indirect 
economic effects associated with the emergence of circular business models. This 
emergence, conditional on improved competitiveness of circular modes of production, 
will place downward pressure on prices and are likely to lead to a range of rebound 
effects. Households may direct new disposable income towards additional consumption, 
and this wi ll have an associated environmental footprint. Further, reduced demand for 
primary materials, and the lower prices that this stimulates, may encourage manufacturing 
firms to use relatively more such inputs. In sum, indirect economic feedbacks are",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,83
"4. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS │ 83 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
important, and potentially could at least partially, offset the direct environmental benefits 
associated with the emergence of a circular business models.23 
Third, comparing the relative environmental potential of different circular business 
models is difficult. Making such an assessment is difficult given that a particular business 
model typically operates in multiple sectors, and has implications across a range of 
environmental impact categories, often in multiple political jurisdictions. Thus, while it 
might be possible to compare the environmental footprint of recycling or repairing an old 
vehicle, blanket statements about the relative desirability of resource recovery vs product 
life extension business models (for example) is fraught. Although the circularity lad der 
approach provides some insight on this issue, it is unclear to what extent the waste 
hierarchy ranking of waste management activities reflects environmental impacts higher 
in the product lifecycle. For example, some LCA studies suggest that reuse may n ot 
necessarily be preferable to recycling when the products involved are long lived, have an 
energy intensive use phase, and are experiencing rapid efficiency improvements. 
Fourth, with respect to the product life extension, sharing, and product service sy stem 
business models, there is a tension between changes in product lifetimes and the diffusion 
of relatively efficient new product designs. Put differently, this tension reflects a tradeoff 
between environmental impacts associated with different parts of the product lifecycle. 
Products that last longer will tend to reduce the extraction and processing of virgin 
resources (and the associated environmental impacts of these activities), but may also 
hinder the diffusion of relatively efficient new products. P roduct category is critical here; 
this issue is again of most concern for products that are long lived, have an energy 
intensive use phase, and are experiencing rapid efficiency improvements. 
Therefore, while the lifecycle environmental impacts of circular  goods and services are 
mostly significantly smaller than those of linear ones, uncertainty about rebound effects, 
product innovation and other factors, tend to muddy the picture and prevent from drawing 
more general conclusions across business models, sec tors and product groups. The 
environmental outcomes of circular business models will therefore need to be carefully 
assessed on a case by case basis.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,84

Notes
 
1  Even the resource recovery business model, which upon first inspection is only relevant 
for the recycling sector, affects a number of extractive sectors via the different mater ials (metals, 
paper, plastics, biomass, etc) that it collects and processes. 
2  And also relative to other intuitive approaches; some studies use estimates of avoided 
resource extraction as a proxy for the associated environmental benefits (e.g., Pothen (2017[84]). 
3  When assessing the results of “comparative” LCAs, it is also important to keep in mind 
what the stated counterfactual is. For example, LCAs that focus on processes that extend product 
lives often assume that the counterfactual is product disposal. In reality, in many cases, not all of 
the end of life product will be disposed since certain components and materials may be recycled.  
4  Further, any such displacement may well take place in j urisdictions other than the one in 
which the circular business model emerges. For example, if increased secondary metal output in 
country X leads to reduced domestic demand for primary raw materials, the reduction in resource 
extraction and processing, and any associated environmental benefits, may take place elsewhere. 
5  An additional level of complexity is introduced by the fact that, for some materials, the 
degree of substitutability declines with each additional material recovery cycle. The static 
character of LCA makes such effects difficult to incorporate.  
6  This is not particularly surprising. It is essentially a restatement of the waste hierarchy 
concept contained in the European Union’s Waste Framework Directive.

recovered materials + external benefits associated with manufacturing final goods with recycled 
rather than primary materials less the external costs associated with collecting, transporting, and 
processing these materials) 
8  See Cooper and Gutwoski (2017[130]) for a fuller discussion of these issues in the context 
of reuse. 
9  IDDRI (2014[23]) use the example of cars and refrigerators. 
10  As discussed in Section 2.2.3, returning a product to its original  condition is central to all 
definitions of remanufacturing. However, that does not necessarily imply performance levels equal 
to contemporarily manufactured versions of the same product, even where remanufacturing is 
complemented with the installation of component upgrades.  
11  One complication is that, due to increasingly interconnected global value chains, the 
upstream and use phase environmental impacts will often emerge in different geographic locations.  
12  It has also been suggested that the term “sh aring” has positive environmental connotations 
in and of itself. This is one explanation for why firms not strictly involved in sharing spare 
capacity seek to label themselves as sharing models (e.g., EU Observer (2017[96]) and European 
Commission (2016[85])).  
13  Any difference in the transport required to use the good is also relevant, but unlikely to be 
of significant magnitude. 
14  As disc ussed further in Section 4.3.4, one potentially positive implication of increased 
utilisation and more rapid product turnover is the removal of old, relatively inefficient products 
from the market.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,85

15  In reality, only a proportion of these hotels would ac tually have been built in the absence 
of Airbnb or other sharing platforms. Increased prices resulting from supply shortages would have 
served to ration some of the excess demand.  
16  The authors state that the energy efficiency of typical European and Nor th American 
residences were compared to those of the most energy efficient hotels (those in the top 5 
percentile). 
17  Some studies take a different approach. Haefili et al. (2006) ask individuals without access 
to a car sharing scheme to describe their res ponse to the hypothetical introduction of one. Firnkorn 
and Muller (2011[102]) ask individuals about their planned response to a recently introduced car 
sharing scheme.  
18  Cervero, Golub and Nee (2007[107]) partially address these concerns by utilising a 
difference in difference approach. The behaviour of members and non -members is documented at 
two times: the introduction of a car sharing scheme and five years later. In theory, this allows 
changes in transport behaviour not associated with car sharing to be isolated.   
19  The authors demonstrate this with the example of repaired or refurbished smartphones. 
According to them, second hand phones are seen as poor substitutes for new phones in developing 
countries. As such, they are often exported and sold in developing countries where the alternative 
is no phone at all. 
20  Or, a s stated by  ADEME (2016[92]) in the context of sharing models, “ collaborative 
consumption does not necessarily signify responsible consumption. Indeed, the environmental gain 
depends strongly on the traditional activity that the collaborative activity replaces ”. The potential 
replacement of public (rather than private) modes of tran sport by car -pooling and sharing is one 
such example.  
21  To further complicate matters, individual business models do not necessarily operate in 
isolation, but can interact with each other and, to some extent, become mutually reinforcing.  
22  Some of these environmental benefits – particularly those associated with reduced natural 
resource extraction and processing – will probably accrue in third party jurisdictions (i.e., regions 
with large extractive sectors).  
23  Some business models are probably less su sceptible to rebound effects than others. For 
example, the underlying business case for adopting the classic long life business model is that 
manufacturers can charge a premium for products that are more durable. As the emergence of the 
business model is d riven primarily by changes in consumer preferences, rather than increasing 
price competitiveness, there is less potential for rebound effects.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,86

Chapter 5.  Policy Implications 
This chapter offers a summary of the policy implications that emerge from this report. 
The discussion is intended to provide a set of high level policy principles rather than 
specific guidance for individual business models . Thus, the factors that serve to  hinder 
the general adoption of circular business models are identified, and the set of policy 
approaches that could address them discussed. Developing more specific policy guidance 
would require more detailed analysis of a particular business model within  individual 
sectors: this could be considered for future work.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,98

5.1. The findings of this report 
Circular business models – those that serve to reduce the extraction and use of natural 
resources and the generation of industrial and consumer wastes – operate in a number of 
economic sectors. Because these business models use already existing materials and 
products as inputs, their environmental footprint tends to be considerably smaller than 
that for traditional business models. This idea is supported by the life  cycle analysis 
literature, where it has been demonstrated that secondary raw materials, repaired and 
remanufactured products, and shared assets typically have relatively small global 
warming, acidification, and toxicity potential. As such, the continued a doption of circular 
modes of production, to the extent that it displaces production from traditional modes 
(and notwithstanding any associated rebound effects) could have important first order 
environmental benefits. 
The market penetration of circular busi ness models remains limited. The most successful 
circular mode of production – producing secondary raw materials from waste – only 
accounts for 30 to 40% of the physical output of the sectors that it is best established in 
(pulp and paper and steel). Other  forms of circular production – refurbishment and 
remanufacturing, the sharing of spare capacity, and the provision of services rather than 
products – continue to represent a small fraction of overall output (either in physical or 
economic terms). Although  it is clear that some of these business models have 
experienced rapid recent growth, much of this has been confined to a handful of 
economic niches. Sharing models in the accommodation sector or product service 
systems in the transport sector are frequent ly cited examples. Transitioning to a more 
circular and resource efficient economy – one where the environmental impacts 
associated with economic production and consumption are significantly reduced – will 
require much more widespread penetration of these business models. Policy can play an 
important role in this respect.  
5.2. The role of policy 
5.2.1. General considerations 
This section offers an initial discussion on how policy can help to promote the broader 
adoption of circular business models. The discussion is intended to provide a set of high 
level policy principles rather than specific guidance for individual business models. The 
reason is twofold. First, not all circular business models are created equal; it is not 
entirely clear which have the greatest scalability and environmental potential. As such, it 
may be prudent to avoid targeting policies at specific business models, and instead focus 
on implementing a policy framework that provides coherent incentives for closing and 
slowing resource loops, and narrowing resource flows throughout the economy.  
Second, the barriers that hinder the emergence of these business mo dels vary widely 
according to the business model considered and the sectors they are applied in. It is 
beyond the scope of this report to consider all possible permutations; developing more 
operational policy guidance would require deeper analysis for spec ific business models 
and sectors. The application of PSS models in two contrasting sectors (urban mobility and 
chemicals) serves to illustrate this. In the former case, the majority of transactions are of a 
B2C nature; the continued adoption of urban car s haring will be driven largely by the 
convenience of sharing and by underlying consumer attitudes towards car ownership. 
Urban transport policy will be a key factor for both. In the case of chemical leasing, 
where the majority of transactions are of a B2B n ature, more widespread uptake will",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,99
"5. POLICY IMPLICATIONS │ 99 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
largely depend on underlying commercial considerations. The stringency of chemicals 
policy is therefore likely to be a key driver (OECD, 2017[1]). 
5.2.2. Common barriers to circular business model adoption and potential 
policy responses 
There are various reasons why the market share of circular business models may be sub -
optimal. One shared characteristic of these business models is that they use virgin 
resources and environm ental goods less intensively than the traditional businesses that 
they compete against. These inputs are cheaper than they would be if the externalities – 
the environmental damages – resulting from their use were addressed. This probably 
serves to provide traditional business models with a competitive advantage. Policy can 
help to ensure that the full environmental costs of production and consumption activities 
are reflected in market prices. 
Another characteristic of many circular business models, particul arly the circular supply, 
resource recovery and product life extension business models, is the need for 
collaboration within and across value chains. Externalities resulting from design decisions 
made by traditional manufacturing firms have implications fo r the feasibility of material 
recovery and product life extension activities further downstream. Similarly, the existence 
of search and transaction costs can make it difficult for industrial symbiosis to emerge 
across sectors. Policy can help to improve collaboration within and across sectoral value 
chains. Fostering industrial symbiosis clusters, promoting online material marketplaces, 
establishing secondary raw material certification schemes, and, more generally, 
facilitation of cooperation within and acr oss value chains may be worthwhile initial 
steps.    
Policy misalignments are sometimes also hindering the emergence of circular business 
models. One example concerns the provision of subsidies to extractive and material 
processing sectors, which can exten d into the billions of dollars for fossil fuels  (OECD, 
2015[2]), metals  (OECD, 2017 [3]), fisheries  (OECD, 2018 [4]), and agriculture (OECD, 
2016[5]). Another example concerns the tendency to tax labour inputs at significantly 
higher rates than capital and natural resource inputs. A recent Club of Rome report on the 
circular economy (Wijkman, Skånberg and Berglund, 2016 [6]) states that, “modern tax 
systems in the EU apply high rates to employment while leaving the use of natural 
resources tax-free or even s ubsidized”. For the same reason as that outlined above, these 
policies probably serve to favour traditional modes of economic production. Policy 
makers could therefore consider what objectives existing fiscal policy is serving, and 
whether a fiscal realignment could lead to improved environmental and equity outcomes.  
There are also a variety of status quo biases that effectively lend inertia to current patterns 
of economic development, often at the expense of the emergence of circular business 
models. One example concerns the elevated price volatility that is present in secondary 
materials markets. This volatility – which is itself a product of limited market 
development – probably dis -incentivises investment in new secondary production 
capacity. Another example concerns the various trade regulations that serve to limit cross 
border flows of secondary materials and used products  (OECD, 2018[7]). While many of 
these restrictions serve a clear purpose within a linear economic system, they may hinder 
the development of the reverse logistics that are central to some circular business models. 
A final example relates to the regulatory exceptions that are often granted to heavily 
polluting or incumbent firms , thereby hindering the entry of firms with more circular 
business models. 1 Policy could therefore aim to ensure that existing regulatory",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,100
"100 │ 5. POLICY IMPLICATIONS 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
frameworks are coherent and fit for purpose, and not serving to preserve an existing 
status quo.  
Another major challe nge concerning status quo bias relates to consumer behaviour. In 
some cases, the development of markets for circular products and services appears to be 
held back by a lack of consumer interest. For example, in most consumer goods sectors, 
there are only a small number of manufacturers that attempt to differentiate themselves by 
marketing long lived, but relatively expensive products (the clothing manufacturer 
Patagonia is one such example). Despite the fact that higher quality products may be cost 
competitive when considered over their useful life, many consumers prefer to opt for low 
quality substitutes.2 Policy makers could therefore consider how existing educational and 
information programs can be improved to provide individuals with a better 
understanding of the unintended consequences of their consumption choices. The use of 
behavioural insights and nudges, such as through labelling requirements, may be a 
promising way forward.  
Policy makers interested in promoting the more widespread adoption of circu lar business 
models could, in addition to addressing the issues highlighted above, implement a range 
of additional enabling policy measures. These policies will clearly differ according to the 
business model concerned, but can be thought of generally as promoting either the supply 
of circular products (“supply -push measures”) or demand for them (“demand -pull 
measures”). Examples of the former include eco -design standards, strengthened EPR 
schemes, and the provision of targeted R&D funding. Examples of the l atter include 
differentiated VAT rates, recycled content mandates, product labelling standards, and 
green public procurement. 
Finally, one issue highlighted in this review is the importance of rebound effects, 
whereby initial reductions in resource extract ion and use are partially offset via various 
indirect economic feedbacks. Any future transition to a more resource efficient and 
circular economy will be at least partially driven by the diffusion of material efficient 
production technologies and the emerg ence of more cost competitive circular business 
models. The resulting reduction in price levels is likely to trigger a rebound effect as 
consumers allocate the associated savings to additional consumption, and manufacturers 
substitute towards inputs that h ave become relatively cheap (probably including natural 
resources). There is little that policy makers can or should do to influence the magnitude 
of these effects; they are a natural consequence of using material and other production 
inputs more efficiently. That said, policy can influence the composition (and therefore the 
environmental footprint) of the rebound effect by ensuring that the full social costs of 
production and consumption are reflected in market prices.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,101

Notes
 
1  Consider the exemptions that large carbon emitting sectors – steel and agriculture for 
example – receive in some emissions trading schemes 
2  This issue is aggravated in certain sectors – apparel and clothing for example – by fast 
moving consumer trends. Research undertaken in the United Kingdom indicates that the average 
consumer s pends GBP 1 700 on clothes ann ually, but that around 30% of the clothes that are 
already owned have not been used for one year (WRAP, 2017[125]).

Annex A. Case examples 
Circular supply models: furniture manufacturing at Nico Spacecraft (from National 
Zero Waste Council, 2015 ([1])) 
Nico Spacecraft designs and builds furniture, cabinetry and interiors for the residential 
market. Drawing from their global experience, the owners seek their inspiration in 
quality, good design and environmental principles. Plywood is a primary building 
material, so they sought out a plywood product in harmony with their environmental 
ethic: Purebond® by Columbia Forest Products. Nico Spacecraft has found that the 
PureBond® plywood they now use in most of their projects satisfies their quality, design 
and environmental criteria. They also use reclaimed materials where they can. Through 
seeking out circular supplies for their small business, Nico Spacecraft has b een able to 
successfully incorporate circular economy practices such as non -toxic materials, design 
for recycling and durability into their products. 
Nico Spacecraft’s circular economy commitments are demonstrated in these other wood 
reuse efforts: 
Urban sourcing of local trees: Every few years the company comes across an opportunity 
to salvage trees. If the species is right, they load, mill, stack and dry it. For example, a 
heritage white Oak tree had to be taken down for safety reasons. The wood was used  for 
furniture and millwork for clients. 
Recycled wood: Nino Spacecraft uses recycled wood for about 20% of its projects, 
sourced from professional salvage companies or directly from client homes. For example, 
first growth fir from old buildings such as a warehouse, school, shipyard and saw mill has 
been used to make furniture. In one unique case outdated heirloom furniture made of 
wood now on the endangered species list was taken apart, milled and re -glued into a 
contemporary look. In another case, clients  were about to discard all their first growth 
Douglas Fir door frames. Nicospacecraft salvaged and stored them for the right project to 
come along.  
Closed loop: with the exception of plastic packaging and five to six gallons a year of 
lacquer thinner which are returned to local recycling facilities, the company has a closed 
loop production process. The company reuses as much of the plastic packaging as it can 
in its own processes. 
Circular supply models: Cradle-to-Cradle® at Tarkett 
Tarkett is a leading ma nufacturer floor covering solutions operating globally around the 
world. Desso, a Tarkett brand for carpet tiles, provides high -quality carpets for 
commercial and domestic use, supplying inter alia the commercial, hospitality, maritime, 
and airline sector.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,104
"104 │ ANNEX A. CASE EXAMPLES 
 
BUSINESS MODELS FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY © OECD 2019 
  
In 2008, prior to the acquisition by Tarkett, Desso launched a corporate strategy based on 
circularity principles which led to a Cradle-to-Cradle® gold level certification in 2015. In 
order to obtain a Cradle -to-Cradle® certification, the use of circular supplies is only the 
first step. Beyond material health and material reutilisation, there are also high standards 
with regards to renewable energy and carbon management, as well as, water stewardship 
and social fairness. 
Desso is currently about to close i ts value chain completely. Milestones on this journey 
were its recyclable carpet tile backing called EcoBase™, its ReStart® collection program 
of old carpets, its Refinity® process , a recycling process which separates the yarn and 
other fibres from the ba cking, currently being re -built to process the post -consumer 
materials more efficiently. Desso is using recycled yarn known as ECONYL® as an input 
material for new carpets. Desso Cradle to Cradle Gold certified EcoBase TM backing is 
fully recyclable in Desso own production facility. The figure below depicts an illustration 
of Desso’s technical cycle.

Resource recovery models: Industrial Symbiosis in Denmark 
The Kalundborg Symbiosis industrial park is located 100km west from the Danish capital 
Copenhagen. It is perhaps one of the best -known examples for successfully putting the 
industrial symbiosis concept into practice. As a complete closed -loop industrial 
ecosystem it enables firms to directly sell materials, water, and energy to each other. This",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,105

income for the participating firms. See also the figure below for an illustrat ion of the 
Kalundborg Symbiosis site.

The eco -industrial park’s dense web of pipelines and symbiotic relationships between 
firms of different industries has gradually developed over time. The earliest coopera tion 
between the municipality of Kalundborg and Statoil’s (former Esso) in 1961 marked the 
starting point for this large -scale industrial experiment. The current park still features the 
local municipality together with eight other companies. Among them are  the world’s 
biggest insulin producer (Novo Nordisk), the world’s biggest enzyme producer 
(Novozymes), the largest water treatment plant in Northern Europe (Kalundborg 
Forsyning), and the world’s first bio-ethanol demonstration facility (Dong Energy). 
In t erms of the environmental benefits, Kalundborg Symbiosis manages to achieve 
significant resource savings for its participating entities. The table below lists a number of 
key resources and emission that can be avoided each year, such as water, biomass, and air 
pollutants.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,106

Resource recovery models: upcycling at FREITAG 
FREITAG is a Swiss manufacturer of bags, accessories, and clothing founded in 1993 by 
Markus and Daniel Freitag. The company produces its bags from used truck tarpaulins, 
car safety belts, and old bicycle inner tubes. By upcycling these materials, new  value is 
created from what would otherwise be discarded waste. FREITAG has gained 
considerable scale in recent decades, each year around 400 000 products are produced out 
of 460 tons of truck tarps, 130 000 car seatbelts, and 12 000 bicycle inner tubes 
(FREITAG, 2018[5]). 
Product life extension models: remanufacturing at Caterpillar 
Caterpillar is the world industry leader of construction and mining equipment, diesel and 
natural gas engines, industrial  gas turbines and diesel electric locomotives. Its brand 
“Cat® Reman” sells exclusively remanufactured products and is currently employing 
around 4 000 people in 17 locations worldwide (Lacy and Rutqvist, 2 015[6]). In 2014, 
Caterpillar remanufactured more 2 million components with associated material savings 
of 75 400 tons (Waste Management World, 2016[7]). 
As a manufacturer of capital intensive mac hinery, remanufacturing makes sense from a 
business perspective: Around 65% of its operating expenses are already material -related 
(Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2016 [8]). Caterpillar then sells its rema nufactured products 
at a discount compared to new ones, but with an identical warranty . Still, it is more 
profitable to sell a remanufactured product than a brand new one, in particular when it is 
leased out. Then gross profits can be up to 2.75 times higher than selling original 
equipment (Lacy and Rutqvist, 2015[6]). 
Remanufacturing at Caterpillar is also desirable from an environmental perspective. 
Around 86% less energy is consumed during remanufacturing compared to producing a 
new product from virgin material. Remanufacturing a cylind er head, for example, uses 
86% less energy, 93% less water, and emits 61% less GHGs (Snodgress, 2012[9]).",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,107

Sharing models: sharing at the Toronto Tool Library (from the National Zero 
Waste Council (2015[1])) 
Toronto Tool Library is a non -profit social enterprise that lends specialized tools to 
community members. The Tool Library’s members borrow tools in the same way they 
would borrow a library b ook. The Tool Library has over 3 000 tools available for loan 
including home repair, construction and renovation, gardening and landscaping, and 
bicycle repair tools. The tools range from simple screw drivers and drills, to table saws, 
welding equipment, p ower generators. Four 3 -D printers and a laser cutter are available 
for use onsite. The library is a money - and space-saving alternative to ownership. Tool 
sharing reduces consumption and waste. The philosophy of the library – and what sets it 
apart as a s ocial enterprise – is that it is not trying to maximize profit but trying to 
maximize membership and access. 
In early 2013, Toronto Tool Library posted a call for tool and financial donations on the 
internet and through the local media. The request went viral and the Library received over 
1 000 tools. Subsequently, the library was able to build its inventory primarily through 
donations. The donated tools not only created a community asset, but put unused goods 
back in circulation and kept them out of the la ndfill. The Tool Library secured space for 
their first location in the basement of a recreation centre. About 100 volunteers 
participated in the initial renovations to convert a basement storage space into a 
community hub for sharing tools. The Tool Library also received USD 8 000 in donations 
to cover renovation costs. For inventory and membership management they used 
MyTurn’s tool lending library software which was available for free. The business 
community also provided start -up support. For example, Can adian Tire and The Mibro 
Group donated tools and the local Salvation Army offered $5 thrift store discounts to tool 
donors. 
The Tool Library has incubated other circular economy sharing services, from a kitchen 
library to a repair café and swapping. These help foster public acceptance of the sharing 
concept. 
The Kitchen Library lends expensive and rarely used kitchen appliances to its members, 
and offers cooking and baking workshops. It operated out of the Tool Library’s premises 
in its first year before re locating to space closer to high -density living, a move expected 
to enhance its viability.  
The Repair Café is a monthly event held in partnership with several community groups 
such as the Toronto Public Library in which people bring and repair their broke n 
appliances. By repairing rather than discarding broken appliances, participants extend the 
life of their goods, reduce further consumption and landfill waste and save money. 
To further reduce consumption and waste, and promote its sharing philosophy, the  Tool 
Library runs swapping events, such as an Alternative Christmas gift fair in which people 
bring and swap lightly used or new items considered giftable. Similar events are held for 
other high consumption holidays such as Halloween and Valentines – shifting the public 
norm from buying to swapping.",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,108

Sharing models: sharing at Peerby 
Sharing models have become increasingly popular in recent years. One major catalyst for 
this development was the last financial and economic crisis starting in 2007 which led to 
higher unemployment rates and less purchasing power, especially among young pe ople. 
In this changed context, it became more attractive to share existing goods rather than 
buying brand new ones. Other factors that have contributed to the rise of peer -to-peer 
renting communities are lower entry barriers for creating and hosting online  platforms, as 
well as a cultural shift in consumer mentality towards more sustainability (EPRS, 
2016[10]). 
Durable household goods are underutilised assets that can be shared relatively easy. The 
Dutch platform Peerby started in 2012, specializing in these kinds of transactions between 
peers. Since then they have expended from their home market in the Netherlands to 
Belgium, France, Germany, and the US. More than 15 000 members are participating in 
the network either via the desktop version on their computer or via the mobile app 
(TechCrunch, 2013[11]). An advantage compared to similar platforms of this kind is that 
borrowers do not have to actively search for someone in the network who owns that item. 
Instead a borrowing request will be pushed to 100 people in close proximity. This way, 
80% of all requests are apparently fulfilled within 30 minutes of their posting. Peer -
review and rating systems en sure that the community remains highly quality and 
responsive.  
Peerby is completely free for its members, while receiving funding support from the 
DOEN Foundation, Clinton Foundation, and Sanoma Media (Lacy and Rutqvist, 2015[6]). 
At the same time, the platform is testing several premium options for members, such as 
subscription plans for high-value item and opt-in insurances.  
Product Service System models: light as a service at Philips 
Philips started to experiment with the ESCO business model after being approached by 
one of its clients, the German architect Thomas Rau. Both sides agreed on a specific 
outcome: an exact level of brightness for Mr Rau’s architect’s office in Amsterdam. It 
was left to P hilips how to achieve this goal with the most cost -effective solution. Philips 
would also retain ownership of its lighting equipment, being in charge of the installation, 
maintenance, upgrades, and end -of-life recovery. By applying the newest lighting 
technology – light-emitting diode (LED) lights – Philips was able to cut the energy costs 
of the architect’s office by 35%. 
After this successful project, Philips then reached out to public clients and approached the 
city of Washington, DC. The company offered to replace over 13 000 light fixtures in the 
city’s parking garage with LED lights at no cost to the city. Only afterwards, Philips 
would earn money as a portion of the projected energy savings. The replacement was 
forecasted to reduce the energy usage by  68% or 15 million kWatt hours per year, 
resulting in $2 million in annual savings. It was estimated that these savings will remove 
over 11 000 metric tons of CO2 from the environment which is equivalent to removing 
over 2 300 cars from the road (Lacy and Rutqvist, 2015[6]; Philips, 2013[12]) 
The case of Philips shows that there are large environmental and economic benefits from 
upgrading existing lighting infrastructures. The global potential of this practice can be 
further illustrated by referring to the Enlighten Initiative  which is a public /private 
partnership between the United Nations Environment Program, OSRAM, and Philips",../data/raw/business_models_circular_economy_oecd.pdf,109

Lighting, with the support of the Global Environment Facility. The website states that the 
share of electricity used for lighting accounts for around 15% of global energy 
consumption and for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. By switching to efficient 
on-grid and off -grid solutions, more than $140 billion could be sa ved every year, 
reducing CO2 emissions by 580 million tons annually (U4E, 2018[13]).  
Product Service System models: access to rather than ownership of garments at 
Rent Frock Repeat (from the National Zero Waste Council (2015[1])) 
Rent frock repeat is a Toronto -based online dress rental service that ships across Canada 
via Canada Post. The company offers members designer dress rentals through its  e-
commerce site as an alternative to purchasing expensive dresses that are rarely used. The 
company shops for the best designer dresses from around the world, visiting top fashion 
shows and showrooms, and then makes the dresses available for a fraction of  the retail 
price. Customers save time, money and space and look fabulous at their events. 
Technology makes the business possible and attention to their customers’ needs make it 
popular. Over 57 000 on -line users browse the company’s website for the perfec t dress 
for their big night out. To help customers find the perfect dress on -line the company 
includes styling tips for a variety of occasions and body types. They have all sizes from 0-
24 and customers can rent a second size for only $10 to ensure fit. Me mbers also have 
access to private fitting appointments in the Toronto and Ottawa areas, private parties and 
phone or Skype consultations. 
The business model has really struck a chord with customers and investors. Rent frock 
Repeat raised $1.15 million from two Ottawa-based angel investors in November 2014. A 
wise investment when you consider that it is estimated that 40% of Canadians are sharers 
and predict that the Sharing Economy is expected to double in the next year; Companies 
that embrace sharing will win loyal customer and increase market share. The angel 
investor funding allows Rent Frock Repeat to respond the growing popularity of dress 
rentals in Canada by opening up new storefronts. RfR is scheduled to open its Ottawa 
store in summer 2015 and plans to open a store in Calgary as well.

Business Models for the Circular Economy
OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR POLICY
Natural resources, and the materials derived from them, represent the physical basis for the economic system. 
Recent decades have witnessed an unprecedented growth in demand for these resources, which has triggered 
interest from policy makers in transitioning to a more resource efficient and circular economy. This report 
presents a typology of five circular business models that could support the transition to a more resource 
efficient and circular economy: circular supply, resource recovery, product life extension, sharing, and product 
service system models. It reviews the current market penetration and assesses the potential scalability of each 
business model. Environmental potential is also discussed, as well as risks and unintended consequences 
that could result from a more widespread adoption of these business models. The report provides a broad set 
of
 policy approaches that could help alleviate some of the barriers that currently hinder the widespread adoption 
of circular business models.
